<p begin="00:01:39.720" end="00:01:44.820" style="s2">Today we are talking about nationalism,</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.540" end="00:01:47.640" style="s2">we decided that  that we want to choose</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.820" end="00:01:50.159" style="s2">this particular topic, and it is quite logical before the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.640" end="00:01:53.040" style="s2">topic of the speech, but already after the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.159" end="00:01:57.960" style="s2">war, although nationalism is also an</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.040" end="00:02:01.140" style="s2">issue related to war. And I want to start</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.960" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">by quoting a poetic text and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.140" end="00:02:05.100" style="s2">hope that you will recognize it. Clearly,</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:06.979" style="s2">even more  I hope that everyone will</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.100" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">recognize him and be able to continue</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.979" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">speaking these words after me. I quote from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:16.020" style="s2">middle of the text so as not to suggest. For</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:19.500" style="s2">us, she is the only one in the world. Alone in space in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.020" end="00:02:22.860" style="s2">sweet charm, she is in the stars and in the willows,</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.500" end="00:02:25.560" style="s2">she is in every heart, the beat in the flower, the</p>

<p begin="00:02:35.099" end="00:02:39.660" style="s2">by the way it sounded to me right away Maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.980" end="00:02:42.500" style="s2">heard the orchestra  r used to perform</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.660" end="00:02:42.500" style="s2">Love Ukraine</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.379" end="00:02:53.220" style="s2">is love</p>

<p begin="00:02:53.220" end="00:02:58.760" style="s2">And when I quote this song, I actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.760" end="00:03:02.580" style="s2">think to myself that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.760" end="00:03:04.879" style="s2">in 2016 there was such a project, the city of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.580" end="00:03:07.800" style="s2">east is a Black expedition that traveled to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.879" end="00:03:10.680" style="s2">different cities of the Donetsk Luhansk</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.800" end="00:03:13.319" style="s2">regions and tried to find the unique</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.680" end="00:03:15.900" style="s2">codes of these cities  something that you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.319" end="00:03:18.300" style="s2">cling to and around which you can create</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.900" end="00:03:20.760" style="s2">some kind of art object, some kind of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.300" end="00:03:25.080" style="s2">space to find some meaning that will be</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.760" end="00:03:27.060" style="s2">close and familiar to all the citizens, their report</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.080" end="00:03:28.680" style="s2">and the same book about this project is</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.060" end="00:03:31.319" style="s2">publicly available and it is very interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.680" end="00:03:33.720" style="s2">read the methodology of how they</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.319" end="00:03:36.480" style="s2">all this was investigated, in particular, Sasha Mykhed was engaged in this,</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.720" end="00:03:39.299" style="s2">so he discovered for himself,</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.480" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">for example, a photographer called</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.299" end="00:03:44.940" style="s2">Zaliznyak, but in addition, in Lysychansk,</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:48.060" style="s2">they found this code, and this code consisted in the fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.940" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">that Saussure was from Lysychansk and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.060" end="00:03:54.620" style="s2">was necessary to somehow reflect Saussure in the city,</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:58.200" style="s2">and here they quote  be different graffiti,</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.620" end="00:04:01.620" style="s2">this is the text Love Ukraine, but the words</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.200" end="00:04:04.260" style="s2">Love Ukraine were not there, and it was still</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.620" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">local in these separate fragments  entah that</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.260" end="00:04:08.519" style="s2">in electric lights and in a flower and a bird in</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:11.640" style="s2">that and fatigue and that everywhere you can find</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.519" end="00:04:13.860" style="s2">Ukraine And here it corresponds to the code of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.640" end="00:04:15.540" style="s2">particular city and it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.860" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">Actually this text corresponds to the codes of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.540" end="00:04:19.739" style="s2">many Ukrainian cities and to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:21.239" style="s2">our very identities because we its  we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.739" end="00:04:24.060" style="s2">remember. For example, I don&#39;t remember it</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.239" end="00:04:26.699" style="s2">by heart from school, but here I am, we</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.060" end="00:04:28.800" style="s2">start quoting and recalling, and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.699" end="00:04:30.840" style="s2">can get caught up in it, well, you see,</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.800" end="00:04:33.419" style="s2">in fact, I know by heart the text of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.840" end="00:04:36.080" style="s2">postmodernist Sashko Irvanets, who writes &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.419" end="00:04:38.940" style="s2">love Oklahoma at night and  in the afternoon and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.080" end="00:04:41.400" style="s2">in fact I think today these lines</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.940" end="00:04:43.320" style="s2">will be taken away Otherwise And</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.400" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">you can even think about them that this is a certain insult</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.320" end="00:04:48.180" style="s2">because when today we read Love</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:51.419" style="s2">Ukraine, then there is more of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.180" end="00:04:53.699" style="s2">high pathos in it, which in fact we now</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.419" end="00:04:55.560" style="s2">understand and now is the time when we</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.699" end="00:04:58.860" style="s2">we understand all capitalized</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.560" end="00:05:01.320" style="s2">words, the words love, war, homeland, even and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.860" end="00:05:03.000" style="s2">I think, by the way, now is a great time to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.320" end="00:05:04.979" style="s2">also re-read such texts as</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.000" end="00:05:08.160" style="s2">Vivantia because he does not at all deny</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.979" end="00:05:10.280" style="s2">that  Oh, Ukraine must be loved. But he</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.160" end="00:05:12.960" style="s2">offers to look at it from such a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.280" end="00:05:15.539" style="s2">playful point of view, because he is a postmodernist,</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.960" end="00:05:18.900" style="s2">everything is played, he needs this game, he</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.539" end="00:05:20.520" style="s2">cannot imagine himself without it.</p>

<p begin="00:05:53.039" end="00:05:57.960" style="s2">what is Ukraine, it&#39;s quite provocative, and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.860" end="00:05:59.880" style="s2">Vlad comes up with some theses that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.960" end="00:06:02.580" style="s2">he needs, presenting his</p>

<p begin="00:06:02.580" end="00:06:08.720" style="s2">this moment, but I would still ask</p>

<p begin="00:06:09.660" end="00:06:17.220" style="s2">I will wave a little and answer that Ukraine is</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.759" end="00:06:19.139" style="s2">a story, there is a famous phrase by Edward Seid, of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.220" end="00:06:21.539" style="s2">whom you and I are  It was repeatedly mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.139" end="00:06:25.460" style="s2">in this tip that the nation is on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.539" end="00:06:28.620" style="s2">walkie-talkie. That is, this is a certain story and</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.000" end="00:06:46.639" style="s2">of us has our own story about Ukraine. Ukraine is</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.220" end="00:06:50.460" style="s2">important and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.639" end="00:06:54.240" style="s2">definitely Ukraine is the sum of certain</p>

<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:05.880" style="s2">our homes. Our parents,</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.000" end="00:07:09.599" style="s2">grandmothers, they told us something  about one&#39;s connection with the</p>

<p begin="00:07:09.599" end="00:07:15.000" style="s2">that is why Ukraine can be very different and</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.020" end="00:07:16.620" style="s2">it is normal. Why is it so</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.000" end="00:07:19.020" style="s2">different for every Ukrainian? It is very</p>

<p begin="00:07:20.940" end="00:07:25.560" style="s2">it can be from a</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.460" end="00:07:28.860" style="s2">conversation about how borscht was cooked at your house</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.560" end="00:07:31.800" style="s2">and to some conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.860" end="00:07:33.900" style="s2">comparing patterns on embroidery or whose</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.800" end="00:07:37.380" style="s2">house it is  for example, did you draw Easter eggs or</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.900" end="00:07:39.300" style="s2">not? Ukraine can be very different and now</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.380" end="00:07:42.360" style="s2">I am often asked</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.300" end="00:07:44.099" style="s2">by foreigners how I would</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.360" end="00:07:45.960" style="s2">describe the Ukrainian identity,</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.099" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">because they do it for a while, that is,</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.960" end="00:07:51.660" style="s2">I had the opportunity to prepare and have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:53.639" style="s2">spectacular preparation, and every time I speak</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.660" end="00:07:56.520" style="s2">now with  foreigners, I say that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.639" end="00:07:58.919" style="s2">Ukrainian identity is very inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.520" end="00:08:02.539" style="s2">for me, this is the most important thing to explain, I</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.919" end="00:08:05.759" style="s2">always say that Ukraine was formed under the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.539" end="00:08:08.580" style="s2">influence of different cultures and different</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:09.599" style="s2">state entities, these are very different empires,</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.580" end="00:08:12.240" style="s2">this is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.599" end="00:08:14.220" style="s2">Russian Empire - this is the Austro-Hungarian</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:16.620" style="s2">Empire, before that we also have the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.220" end="00:08:19.500" style="s2">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth  there is the influence of Islamic</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.620" end="00:08:22.919" style="s2">culture, we have different backgrounds, we</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.500" end="00:08:24.900" style="s2">have very different cultures, stories, languages,</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.919" end="00:08:27.539" style="s2">we have such different national</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.900" end="00:08:29.940" style="s2">communities in this country, but what</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.539" end="00:08:31.620" style="s2">unites them is this desire to be together, this is respect</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.940" end="00:08:33.899" style="s2">for this individual who decided to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.620" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">together AND unite in a community and  it</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.899" end="00:08:37.320" style="s2">actually makes us terribly</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.519" end="00:08:40.140" style="s2">inclusive. That&#39;s something that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.320" end="00:08:43.080" style="s2">think is true  we are determined by chance.</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.140" end="00:08:44.700" style="s2">I will quote Myroslav Popovych from an essay on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.080" end="00:08:48.540" style="s2">history of Ukrainian culture, where he writes</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.700" end="00:08:51.240" style="s2">that what makes people Ukraine is not blood</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.540" end="00:08:53.880" style="s2">and land, Ukraine makes them, and the culture to</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.240" end="00:08:55.860" style="s2">which they are involved.</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.880" end="00:08:58.459" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:08:55.860" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:08:58.459" end="00:09:04.860" style="s2">everything else And I also</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:08.760" style="s2">asked myself this question and what Ukraine is</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.860" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">and how we imagine it to be. For a long time, this</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.760" end="00:09:13.560" style="s2">function was performed by television, and since then the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:17.040" style="s2">Internet began to do it. When we</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.560" end="00:09:21.300" style="s2">were offered how we can imagine ourselves, I am</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.040" end="00:09:25.580" style="s2">sure that you do not remember this show  but</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.300" end="00:09:29.399" style="s2">I remember in 2009 there was a show on the 1+1 channel</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.580" end="00:09:31.860" style="s2">I love Ukraine, I even</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.399" end="00:09:34.920" style="s2">watched it And recently YouTube threw it to me and it</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.860" end="00:09:37.800" style="s2">was introduced by Lidia Taran and</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.920" end="00:09:40.680" style="s2">there were two teams, the yellow team and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.800" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">the blue team, people dressed in cubes</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.680" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">no no  this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.820" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">this and on another channel and in this show there was</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.899" end="00:09:53.399" style="s2">a yellow team and a blue team Nastia</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:55.080" style="s2">Kamenskyi and Potap, respectively, and there were</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.399" end="00:09:57.000" style="s2">some stars and they performed various</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.080" end="00:10:00.360" style="s2">tasks  and they answered questions there</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.000" end="00:10:03.140" style="s2">were such plasters, sunflowers were sticking out Lydia</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.360" end="00:10:06.779" style="s2">Taran was in some bright dresses with</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.140" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">folk patterns and there was a song I</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.779" end="00:10:12.120" style="s2">love Ukraine and Everyone said Do you love</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:14.940" style="s2">Ukraine and the whole hall</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.120" end="00:10:18.779" style="s2">yes the country and now Let&#39;s guess</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.940" end="00:10:21.420" style="s2">what the word zarevo means and  everyone guesses</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.779" end="00:10:23.519" style="s2">what the word zarivo means. Well, it sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.420" end="00:10:25.980" style="s2">terrible dream of a worker of Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.519" end="00:10:29.700" style="s2">culture. I don&#39;t know what else to call it,</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.980" end="00:10:32.940" style="s2">and it is, because then in 2012 this show was</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.700" end="00:10:34.980" style="s2">resuscitated, and he is already Yuriy Gorbunov,</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.940" end="00:10:37.440" style="s2">but the essence has not changed. There, too, you had to</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.980" end="00:10:40.160" style="s2">guess the melody to unravel  a mystery. And this</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:41.720" style="s2">show was positioned both times as an</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.160" end="00:10:45.240" style="s2">entertaining</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.720" end="00:10:48.420" style="s2">humorous show. If you have a virgin, you</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.240" end="00:10:51.240" style="s2">probably laugh at the jokes of the stars with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.420" end="00:10:55.620" style="s2">where you try to learn some new</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.240" end="00:10:58.500" style="s2">interesting facts about Ukraine.</p>

<p begin="00:11:03.420" end="00:11:08.279" style="s2">in particular, these</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:10.440" style="s2">TV presenters offer us to imagine Ukraine, because</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.279" end="00:11:13.500" style="s2">then these same TV presenters offer us</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.440" end="00:11:16.620" style="s2">to imagine it during the celebration of  I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.500" end="00:11:18.660" style="s2">Independence I thought to myself And what will</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.620" end="00:11:21.420" style="s2">Independence Day be like this year, it&#39;s clear that</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.660" end="00:11:24.959" style="s2">it won&#39;t be a holiday, but we remember what</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.420" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">we had in the 19-20 and 21st years because of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.959" end="00:11:30.180" style="s2">asterisk, why I don&#39;t remember the previous years</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:32.100" style="s2">because it was up to 2014  we probably don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.180" end="00:11:33.779" style="s2">remember what Independence Day is. It</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.100" end="00:11:35.660" style="s2">was some kind of scene, some kind of concert on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.779" end="00:11:39.000" style="s2">Maidan, which may have been broadcast somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.660" end="00:11:42.480" style="s2">since then. It was the main part of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.000" end="00:11:45.480" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:11:42.480" end="00:11:48.120" style="s2"></p>

<p begin="00:11:48.120" end="00:11:52.320" style="s2">to protect them from this,</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.040" end="00:11:54.240" style="s2">all the Independence Day celebrations over the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.320" end="00:11:56.399" style="s2">past three years refreshed my</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:11:58.680" style="s2">memory, so to speak, because Well, it&#39;s good, because they watched</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.399" end="00:12:00.899" style="s2">it for the first time, because I didn&#39;t watch it then. Well,</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.680" end="00:12:03.240" style="s2">you liked it. So I had a</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.899" end="00:12:05.459" style="s2">lot of fun. I rolled my eyes and looked away.</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.240" end="00:12:07.740" style="s2">About  ecological expedition That&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.459" end="00:12:09.959" style="s2">it was, I&#39;m used to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.740" end="00:12:11.940" style="s2">cultural studies always requires me to</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.959" end="00:12:14.339" style="s2">experiment on myself on my</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.940" end="00:12:17.100" style="s2">psyche Well, that&#39;s what I&#39;m actually doing and</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.339" end="00:12:19.680" style="s2">I&#39;m doing it, come on, say it, So 2019  year</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.100" end="00:12:22.019" style="s2">Independence Day they try to</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.680" end="00:12:25.380" style="s2">sing different anthems then</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.019" end="00:12:27.420" style="s2">different choirs sing it and then Alina Pash</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.380" end="00:12:30.600" style="s2">Tina Karol in a white dress over the Maidan</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.420" end="00:12:33.240" style="s2">also sings to them and there are a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.600" end="00:12:37.079" style="s2">variations of how it sounds And it was criticized a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.240" end="00:12:39.720" style="s2">then because how can you</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.079" end="00:12:41.339" style="s2">put such a thing in the anthem  for example, the rap of Vitalina</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.720" end="00:12:43.220" style="s2">Pash and why do you need to do it at all</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.339" end="00:12:45.720" style="s2">And why exactly on this</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.220" end="00:12:47.579" style="s2">musical composition because it is not even a</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.720" end="00:12:49.139" style="s2">song This anthem is a specific genre</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.579" end="00:12:51.660" style="s2">you need to do these</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.139" end="00:12:54.120" style="s2">experiments Why didn&#39;t you take them Sichovy</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.660" end="00:12:56.760" style="s2">Streltsy or some popular folk</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.120" end="00:12:59.579" style="s2">song And there is no discussion  the prices</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.760" end="00:13:03.720" style="s2">ended and then Alan Badoev put</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.579" end="00:13:06.480" style="s2">it up in 2020, we don’t have any anniversary, the 29th</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.720" end="00:13:08.940" style="s2">anniversary of Independence and there is a musical history, do you</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.480" end="00:13:11.579" style="s2">remember the musical history of Ukraine where</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.940" end="00:13:14.700" style="s2">there were 42 songs on Sofia Square then there</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.579" end="00:13:16.860" style="s2">were quarantine restrictions and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.700" end="00:13:19.740" style="s2">not only watched it for myself, but I</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.860" end="00:13:21.480" style="s2">got up What  I wrote about it Well, as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.740" end="00:13:24.300" style="s2">critic, journalism, as well as journalists,</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.480" end="00:13:27.600" style="s2">as well as public figures, how did they react to it</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.300" end="00:13:30.120" style="s2">and  then the interview of Lyosh</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.600" end="00:13:32.160" style="s2">Bondarenko from Lirun for public</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.120" end="00:13:34.200" style="s2">radio was very cool, where he said that there is no</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.160" end="00:13:38.700" style="s2">bad or good music, there are different</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.200" end="00:13:40.800" style="s2">audiences, so in this selection 42</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.700" end="00:13:42.899" style="s2">songs were collected and songs in Ukrainian and</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.800" end="00:13:45.540" style="s2">in Russian, songs that are really</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.899" end="00:13:48.300" style="s2">in their own way  reflect the history of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.540" end="00:13:49.920" style="s2">Ukrainian music over the years so that</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.300" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">every year there</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.920" end="00:13:54.600" style="s2">was a different song every year</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:57.000" style="s2">And that it has its own right to life,</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.600" end="00:13:59.339" style="s2">but why were there stories, what were the</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.000" end="00:14:00.860" style="s2">controversies then, that there were artists who performed there</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.339" end="00:14:03.420" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.860" end="00:14:06.180" style="s2">also performed in Russia at that time</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.420" end="00:14:08.040" style="s2">Dorn was not there, but Lyosha</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.180" end="00:14:11.579" style="s2">Bondarenko and public journalists</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.040" end="00:14:14.579" style="s2">throw things like, for example, what about Potap.</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.579" end="00:14:17.220" style="s2">He performed, for example, after the 14th year in</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.579" end="00:14:19.260" style="s2">Russia. Why does he present some</p>

<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:39.620" style="s2">only two years ago, you see, it caused</p>

<p begin="00:14:39.620" end="00:14:43.740" style="s2">public resonance and there was a question</p>

<p begin="00:14:43.740" end="00:14:48.600" style="s2">why there are no other genres, why the musical</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.079" end="00:14:51.019" style="s2">history of Ukraine consists only of</p>

<p begin="00:14:55.500" end="00:15:01.380" style="s2">decisions  because in addition to the audio part, there was also a</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.199" end="00:15:04.199" style="s2">visual picture that was very scary,</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.380" end="00:15:07.139" style="s2">well, that is, there were very bad costumes, a</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.199" end="00:15:09.480" style="s2">very bad production and it was really</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.139" end="00:15:12.060" style="s2">Everything really It was all bad but it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.480" end="00:15:15.480" style="s2">interpreted as something good because there were</p>

<p begin="00:15:47.100" end="00:15:51.600" style="s2">Well, this is the version of the story  which was also</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.079" end="00:15:53.880" style="s2">criticized because there was</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.600" end="00:15:56.160" style="s2">almost no word at all about Stalin&#39;s repressions,</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.880" end="00:15:57.959" style="s2">it somehow slipped by so quickly,</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.160" end="00:16:00.180" style="s2">there was no mention of the First World War</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.959" end="00:16:02.699" style="s2">at all, the emphasis was placed. Quite</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.180" end="00:16:06.120" style="s2">strangely, historians first of all criticized</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.699" end="00:16:08.639" style="s2">it because, in contrast to all this performance,</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.120" end="00:16:10.920" style="s2">it was called precisely the word Performance in the</p>

<p begin="00:16:19.800" end="00:16:24.540" style="s2">point of view, accents where they</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.440" end="00:16:27.660" style="s2">mention Stalin and repressions about everything, that is,</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.540" end="00:16:30.779" style="s2">not some pattern of non-acceptance of the history of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.660" end="00:16:33.120" style="s2">Ukraine, but still some more</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.779" end="00:16:35.279" style="s2">progressive</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.120" end="00:16:37.259" style="s2">self  I forgot why I told all this,</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.279" end="00:16:40.680" style="s2">I just wanted to ask</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.259" end="00:16:44.040" style="s2">why you are inclined to tell a story that</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.680" end="00:16:47.480" style="s2">how everyone chooses the story that he can</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.040" end="00:16:50.540" style="s2">tell about Ukraine, I will say</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.480" end="00:16:54.779" style="s2">something unfortunate, but</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.540" end="00:16:58.079" style="s2">as everyone knows how, he chooses this</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.779" end="00:17:00.779" style="s2">story and there is no disrespect or</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.079" end="00:17:04.140" style="s2">something negative because our choice of</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.779" end="00:17:07.439" style="s2">history depends on our experience, we</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.140" end="00:17:10.679" style="s2">said  about these private contexts. So,</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.439" end="00:17:13.199" style="s2">what were you told at home? Some were</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.679" end="00:17:15.720" style="s2">really told, for example, in various</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.199" end="00:17:18.600" style="s2">images about Stalin&#39;s repressions. Although it is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.720" end="00:17:21.660" style="s2">very difficult lecture for a child, and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.600" end="00:17:24.480" style="s2">some did not, then there was a school that was very</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.660" end="00:17:26.459" style="s2">different in different regions. I once</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.480" end="00:17:29.400" style="s2">did my own anthropological research,</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.459" end="00:17:33.059" style="s2">but in a different way.  I had Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.400" end="00:17:36.360" style="s2">and you didn&#39;t have it yet, and I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.059" end="00:17:40.440" style="s2">Here&#39;s what they said. Please tell me,</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.360" end="00:17:42.960" style="s2">dear friends, what songs did you sing</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.440" end="00:17:44.820" style="s2">in music lessons, because at my</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.960" end="00:17:47.900" style="s2">Lviv gymnasium there was such a senior</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.820" end="00:17:50.520" style="s2">teacher whom I remember with pleasure and</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.900" end="00:17:53.179" style="s2">he loved the song very much</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.520" end="00:17:57.780" style="s2">He sat down at the piano and</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.179" end="00:18:00.120" style="s2">played the songs of the Sich Riflemen. We sang them in chorus, and there</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.780" end="00:18:02.280" style="s2">we had very different songs about Tyutyunnyk and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.120" end="00:18:04.620" style="s2">Galician girls were upset, and all that, well, that</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.280" end="00:18:06.140" style="s2">is, we had a normal set, but I</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.620" end="00:18:09.000" style="s2">understood that it was obvious that my story was</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.140" end="00:18:12.179" style="s2">unconventional in the context of Ukraine, and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.000" end="00:18:15.620" style="s2">it was.  because a lot of people sang Well,</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.179" end="00:18:19.980" style="s2">our free homeland did not develop, but the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.620" end="00:18:24.240" style="s2">apple and pear trees blossomed. This is my</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.980" end="00:18:26.280" style="s2">option.  we had a music teacher with an accordion. By the</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.240" end="00:18:29.640" style="s2">way, he is a very progressive man, because the city of</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.280" end="00:18:33.000" style="s2">Kyiv is a star, the city of Kyiv, Solomyanskyi</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.640" end="00:18:35.179" style="s2">district, school 159,</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.000" end="00:18:38.039" style="s2">and he</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.179" end="00:18:41.580" style="s2">played the accordion, and we wrote a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.039" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">notes, and at that time he taught us</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.580" end="00:18:47.820" style="s2">such a subject as the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:50.760" style="s2">study of Ukraine. And from him it is very  good</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.820" end="00:18:53.220" style="s2">subject I ask you not to frown because later</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.760" end="00:18:56.880" style="s2">with the teacher of Ukrainian studies in the ninth</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.220" end="00:18:59.520" style="s2">grade I wrote a manic paper about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.880" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">origin of the name Ukraine and got</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.520" end="00:19:04.039" style="s2">second place on military questions I</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.679" end="00:19:07.020" style="s2">prepared for this podcast well</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.039" end="00:19:09.380" style="s2">Dima it was too much of a combine I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.020" end="00:19:12.299" style="s2">we will solve it</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.380" end="00:19:15.320" style="s2">music teacher  he actually said</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.299" end="00:19:18.960" style="s2">quite progressive things, he was a cool</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.320" end="00:19:20.640" style="s2">older but modern gentleman, but we still</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.960" end="00:19:23.960" style="s2">wrote the songs by hand and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.640" end="00:19:26.760" style="s2">sang them Nadezhda, my compass is with me,</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.960" end="00:19:30.000" style="s2">you understand what we sang about</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.760" end="00:19:32.600" style="s2">until May 9. Maybe you even</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.000" end="00:19:35.039" style="s2">sang Beatles Yesterday in Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.600" end="00:19:37.320" style="s2">bedles Yesterday  We sang in English</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.039" end="00:19:39.000" style="s2">and in English lessons well But</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.320" end="00:19:42.960" style="s2">wait Now we put a full stop I will</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.000" end="00:19:45.720" style="s2">continue  what I was leaning towards is</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.960" end="00:19:47.760" style="s2">that all this creates that set of history</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.720" end="00:19:49.820" style="s2">and with which we generally come out with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:52.559" style="s2">potential to tell what Ukraine</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.820" end="00:19:54.419" style="s2">is because when they don&#39;t ask what Ukraine is</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.559" end="00:19:57.419" style="s2">And you immediately want to say something</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.419" end="00:20:00.299" style="s2">private and poignant And it&#39;s private and a puppy In</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.419" end="00:20:02.820" style="s2">us  very different actually for various reasons,</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.299" end="00:20:05.280" style="s2">because for example we understand that at</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.820" end="00:20:07.500" style="s2">school during independent Ukraine it</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.280" end="00:20:09.960" style="s2">was possible to sing a song from the time of the Second World</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.500" end="00:20:13.980" style="s2">War that encouraged soldiers to go into battle with</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.960" end="00:20:17.220" style="s2">Soviet soldiers and this creates a set of</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.980" end="00:20:19.039" style="s2">stories that are not always pleasant for us and</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.220" end="00:20:21.419" style="s2">sometimes you find yourself in  in such a rather</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.039" end="00:20:24.120" style="s2">uncomfortable situation when you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.419" end="00:20:26.100" style="s2">this set of your stories does not</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.120" end="00:20:29.700" style="s2">really fit with everything that you see now,</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.100" end="00:20:33.240" style="s2">especially after February 24, you</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.700" end="00:20:35.340" style="s2">talked about tanks, also a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.240" end="00:20:37.620" style="s2">topic that absolutely corresponds to what</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.340" end="00:20:39.980" style="s2">we talked about musicals with you once</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.620" end="00:20:43.260" style="s2">musicals where</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.980" end="00:20:45.299" style="s2">there is a lot of mockery of typical</p>

<p begin="00:20:47.159" end="00:20:53.580" style="s2">Ukraine Well in my opinion Kol  and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.280" end="00:20:56.039" style="s2">ask myself if this is Ukraine, then I say no, then I</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.580" end="00:20:58.679" style="s2">may calm down a little, I will</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.039" end="00:21:01.080" style="s2">calmly say Well, in fact, it is also</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.679" end="00:21:03.539" style="s2">Ukraine, because it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.080" end="00:21:06.480" style="s2">part of popular culture in Ukraine at a certain moment and</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.539" end="00:21:09.360" style="s2">formed discourses here, but do I want</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.480" end="00:21:11.100" style="s2">it to be Ukraine No  I don&#39;t want to and that&#39;s why I</p>

<p begin="00:24:01.080" end="00:24:08.100" style="s2">a new Ukrainian literature appears,</p>

<p begin="00:24:27.360" end="00:24:32.279" style="s2">characterized by the fact that we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.460" end="00:24:34.620" style="s2">know all the members of our community, we</p>

<p begin="00:24:44.240" end="00:24:51.120" style="s2">strung together like a necklace on a thread. Yes,</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.419" end="00:24:54.000" style="s2">but no, at the same time, there are many necklaces,</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.120" end="00:24:56.940" style="s2">many threads, but one appeared, and</p>

<p begin="00:29:46.500" end="00:29:51.120" style="s2">still delimit the west to Russia here</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.240" end="00:29:53.159" style="s2">because when you and I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.120" end="00:29:56.580" style="s2">Gogol, for example, after all, we</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.159" end="00:29:59.279" style="s2">faced criticism and comments where</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.580" end="00:30:02.279" style="s2">we were told that Gogol was not  Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.279" end="00:30:05.299" style="s2">author Why are you dragging him, I will not</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.279" end="00:30:08.580" style="s2">develop this discussion now, but</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.299" end="00:30:11.399" style="s2">we see it in very different examples,</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.580" end="00:30:13.559" style="s2">you and I talked about the frying pan, which</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.399" end="00:30:15.779" style="s2">Russia also tried to  to reappropriate</p>

<p begin="00:30:44.419" end="00:30:49.559" style="s2">I really wanted to talk to you, after</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.279" end="00:30:52.020" style="s2">all, you know in detail just</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.559" end="00:30:55.260" style="s2">to understand what makes a culture</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.020" end="00:30:57.419" style="s2">national, because in some episodes of</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.260" end="00:31:00.179" style="s2">our podcast with you, we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.419" end="00:31:02.519" style="s2">fact that the peculiarity is really  of outstanding</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.179" end="00:31:05.700" style="s2">culture Are they artists Are they</p>

<p begin="00:31:05.700" end="00:31:13.679" style="s2">universality This culture is understandable</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.419" end="00:31:15.960" style="s2">for different contexts and that is why we</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.679" end="00:31:19.320" style="s2">can read with enthusiasm, let&#39;s say,</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.960" end="00:31:21.299" style="s2">novels by Fitzgerald or Hemingway, we</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.320" end="00:31:24.740" style="s2">read Rabelais and Regochu, he is</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.299" end="00:31:27.059" style="s2">understandable to us, we understand that culture is</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.740" end="00:31:30.539" style="s2">international in some way  there is some</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.059" end="00:31:33.299" style="s2">general history of cool  De Kunder&#39;s works</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.539" end="00:31:36.059" style="s2">are very classy in the context of the novel, he calls it the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.299" end="00:31:37.980" style="s2">sum of discoveries, he says that the history of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.059" end="00:31:40.799" style="s2">European novel is the sum of such</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.980" end="00:31:43.679" style="s2">discoveries that can be made only in</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.799" end="00:31:46.019" style="s2">the form of a novel, and he analyzes what these</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.679" end="00:31:48.299" style="s2">discoveries are at the same time. He still talks</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.019" end="00:31:51.120" style="s2">about the importance of national culture and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.299" end="00:31:54.500" style="s2">what it is  this national attachment is what</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.120" end="00:31:54.500" style="s2">makes the culture Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.899" end="00:32:00.980" style="s2">Bohdan, you have thought about this question longer</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.000" end="00:32:00.980" style="s2">than me, maybe you have an answer</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.159" end="00:32:09.380" style="s2">Yes, I have an answer, of course,</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.760" end="00:32:14.580" style="s2">I think that what makes a culture Ukrainian is</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.380" end="00:32:19.080" style="s2">its self-name and language, I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.580" end="00:32:21.539" style="s2">creators If the creator writes in Ukrainian  here is</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.080" end="00:32:25.039" style="s2">enough. We simply understand that most</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.539" end="00:32:28.440" style="s2">likely this is a work of Ukrainian literature,</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.039" end="00:32:31.019" style="s2">it is not so sterile, we understand</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.440" end="00:32:33.500" style="s2">that Ukrainian culture was created in other</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.019" end="00:32:37.440" style="s2">languages ​​and it is not only Russian, it is also</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.500" end="00:32:39.960" style="s2">Polish, Crimean Tatar. These are the different</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.440" end="00:32:42.720" style="s2">cultures we talked about, but it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.960" end="00:32:46.380" style="s2">also the desire to be called Ukrainian and</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.720" end="00:32:49.440" style="s2">belong to this Ukrainian culture and</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.380" end="00:32:51.539" style="s2">here we can choose different examples</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.440" end="00:32:55.140" style="s2">in fact, I stopped at two, I will tell</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.539" end="00:32:56.059" style="s2">you about them, the first one is the director Serhiy</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.140" end="00:32:57.980" style="s2">Loznytsia,</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.059" end="00:33:00.419" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.980" end="00:33:03.000" style="s2">presents himself as a Ukrainian when he</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.419" end="00:33:07.200" style="s2">will be at the Kanoychina other festivals through</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.000" end="00:33:09.480" style="s2">whom we read Ukraine and we understand</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.200" end="00:33:13.679" style="s2">that he broadcasts narratives harmful to Ukraine</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.480" end="00:33:16.440" style="s2">because he is a person who</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.679" end="00:33:19.019" style="s2">calls the Second World War  on the territory of</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.440" end="00:33:21.659" style="s2">Ukraine, a great country, and in general</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.019" end="00:33:25.200" style="s2">he is a person who came out of the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.659" end="00:33:28.320" style="s2">Union, who promotes this cosmopolitanism,</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.200" end="00:33:30.299" style="s2">which was voiced in the Union, which by and</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.320" end="00:33:33.600" style="s2">large meant Russianness and not</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.299" end="00:33:37.200" style="s2">cosmopolitanism, on the other hand, I think of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.600" end="00:33:40.200" style="s2">example of Patricia Kylyna, she is a poet who</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.200" end="00:33:43.799" style="s2">belonged to the New York  group her</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.200" end="00:33:47.399" style="s2">maiden name is Patrytsia nelworean and</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.799" end="00:33:49.080" style="s2">this is a woman who married Yury</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.399" end="00:33:52.080" style="s2">Tarnavskyi and learned Ukrainian and</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.080" end="00:33:53.820" style="s2">began to write very good poems she</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.080" end="00:33:56.100" style="s2">was published by the publishing house of the New York</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.820" end="00:33:59.460" style="s2">group she is an American of Irish</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.100" end="00:34:02.279" style="s2">origin But is the name itself and</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.460" end="00:34:05.279" style="s2">this choice made by her as well  As a Ukrainian poetess,</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.279" end="00:34:07.740" style="s2">I am convinced that she does instead that there are</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.279" end="00:34:10.020" style="s2">vines  this Ukrainian director can be</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.740" end="00:34:13.079" style="s2">viewed in different ways because he chooses the title itself,</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.020" end="00:34:15.419" style="s2">but I have great doubts whether to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.079" end="00:34:17.760" style="s2">call him a Ukrainian director. You</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.419" end="00:34:20.579" style="s2">already mentioned the troubadours of the empire and</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.760" end="00:34:23.220" style="s2">Eva Thompson is really small in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.579" end="00:34:25.980" style="s2">text, which we also advise you to read and</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.220" end="00:34:29.700" style="s2">there Eva Thomson reviews various</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.980" end="00:34:30.440" style="s2">books about colonization and decolonization, and in</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.700" end="00:34:34.079" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.440" end="00:34:37.020" style="s2">books she actually lists what</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.079" end="00:34:39.060" style="s2">can be applied to the Russian Empire of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.020" end="00:34:42.480" style="s2">Soviet Union and what</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.060" end="00:34:45.960" style="s2">can only be applied to Britain and other</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.480" end="00:34:48.000" style="s2">countries and their colonies, and here she</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.960" end="00:34:50.520" style="s2">writes that in the English language there is no</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.000" end="00:34:53.339" style="s2">distinction between nation and state at all</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.520" end="00:34:55.260" style="s2">I thought about citizenship and nationality</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.339" end="00:34:57.720" style="s2">for myself, because for us</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.260" end="00:35:00.300" style="s2">citizenship and nationality are</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.720" end="00:35:02.400" style="s2">slightly different words and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.300" end="00:35:03.900" style="s2">can perceive them differently, we</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.400" end="00:35:06.619" style="s2">can distinguish who you are by</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.900" end="00:35:10.140" style="s2">citizenship, what nationality are you,</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.619" end="00:35:11.480" style="s2">these are two different lines in self-identification</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.140" end="00:35:16.320" style="s2">that is why, in</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.480" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">addition to the example of Patricia Kylyna and Serhiy</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.320" end="00:35:21.119" style="s2">Loznytsia, we can cite</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:24.180" style="s2">Mark Vovchka&#39;s kindergarten, who also studied</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.119" end="00:35:26.579" style="s2">Ukrainian, she was a Russian woman who, yes, she</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.180" end="00:35:28.859" style="s2">studied somewhere in Kharkiv, but who should not</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.579" end="00:35:32.160" style="s2">have written in Ukrainian and should not</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.859" end="00:35:34.320" style="s2">have become the first Ukrainian-speaking</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.160" end="00:35:36.240" style="s2">Ukrainian writer who we not only</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.320" end="00:35:39.180" style="s2">teach in school, but who we really put</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.240" end="00:35:41.339" style="s2">on this  pedestal</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.180" end="00:35:42.960" style="s2">She was the first, but she started to do it. It was</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.339" end="00:35:46.200" style="s2">simple for the wrestler, it was organic. That is, it</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.960" end="00:35:48.839" style="s2">was something not like a choice. It was like a vocation,</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.200" end="00:35:52.320" style="s2">it was her vocation. My vocation.</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.839" end="00:35:56.280" style="s2">To be Ukrainian, God, how beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.320" end="00:35:59.420" style="s2">it is. You know it. I don&#39;t know how to say flirtatiously.</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.280" end="00:36:02.520" style="s2">My vocation is  to inspire So we</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.420" end="00:36:05.040" style="s2">wrote our book like fishermen The Cherry</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.520" end="00:36:07.740" style="s2">Orchard Oksana Zabuzhko also writes This I didn&#39;t mean it</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.040" end="00:36:09.980" style="s2">seriously But I wrote it seriously too</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.740" end="00:36:12.420" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:36:09.980" end="00:36:14.700" style="s2">I would really like to talk about some</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.420" end="00:36:17.760" style="s2">example that will be a little more distant from</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.700" end="00:36:20.339" style="s2">us because there is such a thing that also</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.760" end="00:36:21.619" style="s2">annoys me in communication with  this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.339" end="00:36:24.839" style="s2">what foreigners say</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.619" end="00:36:27.300" style="s2">You are very emotional You are in the epicenter of events You are</p>

<p begin="00:36:27.300" end="00:36:32.940" style="s2">I always want to say Yes no</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.720" end="00:36:35.820" style="s2">I can choose  you are the words that I use, and when</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.940" end="00:36:37.800" style="s2">I say that there is a genocide</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.820" end="00:36:39.619" style="s2">organized by Russia in Ukraine, I say What do</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.800" end="00:36:42.440" style="s2">I mean? Well, this is just an example of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.619" end="00:36:45.300" style="s2">word.</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.440" end="00:36:47.820" style="s2"></p>

<p begin="00:36:53.940" end="00:36:58.680" style="s2">who opened my reading of adult</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.579" end="00:37:02.160" style="s2">literature. I took about a dozen books from my mother,</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.680" end="00:37:04.680" style="s2">there were stamps from the Cortásar and</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.160" end="00:37:06.599" style="s2">others, and I thought, if I want to be an adult</p>

<p begin="00:38:38.540" end="00:38:44.040" style="s2">Czechoslovak writer Milan Kundera</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.240" end="00:38:46.500" style="s2">he is called that despite the fact that he has already</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.040" end="00:38:48.740" style="s2">lived in France for more than 10 years at that time</p>

<p begin="00:38:54.660" end="00:39:00.060" style="s2">already proved to everyone that he chose this language for</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.839" end="00:39:02.579" style="s2">himself, a completely different one</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.060" end="00:39:06.480" style="s2">I am more interested in the conversation about how authors choose a language here,</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.579" end="00:39:09.119" style="s2">that changing the language does not mean changing</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.480" end="00:39:10.980" style="s2">your attribution, they continue to</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.119" end="00:39:13.320" style="s2">call it the choice of a Czechoslovak author,</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.980" end="00:39:16.020" style="s2">although we know that Kundera had a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.320" end="00:39:18.420" style="s2">relationship with his homeland, and only</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.020" end="00:39:21.780" style="s2">a few years ago a prize came to him in</p>

<p begin="00:39:21.780" end="00:39:26.460" style="s2">agreed to accept the Czech citizenship of</p>

<p begin="00:43:36.119" end="00:43:42.300" style="s2">I understood that he doesn&#39;t think anything about</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.819" end="00:43:44.579" style="s2">it, he doesn&#39;t care about it, and if these texts had</p>

<p begin="00:43:57.180" end="00:44:02.700" style="s2">this is some kind of unhealthy approach, but</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.480" end="00:44:07.319" style="s2">I finally have an applied one in literature and</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.700" end="00:44:11.700" style="s2">in art. I really like u</p>
