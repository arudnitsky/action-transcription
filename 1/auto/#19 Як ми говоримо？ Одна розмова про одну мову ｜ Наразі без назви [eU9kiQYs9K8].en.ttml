<p begin="00:01:09.720" end="00:01:15.860" style="s2">one language and this question how do we speak</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.659" end="00:01:18.540" style="s2">We took it from the work of Boris</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.860" end="00:01:22.259" style="s2">Antonenko Davydovich, which was published in</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.540" end="00:01:26.280" style="s2">1970 and is a work about the Ukrainian language</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.259" end="00:01:30.540" style="s2">and its purity. So this work is in the introduction</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.280" end="00:01:33.960" style="s2">Antonenko Davidovych explains that there are many</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.540" end="00:01:36.840" style="s2">different expressions about the language of various artists and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.960" end="00:01:39.000" style="s2">Karl Marquez, including, well, he had</p>

<p begin="00:01:39.000" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">Soviet writer, but in the end he</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:46.799" style="s2">writes about the fact that the struggle for purity and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:49.799" style="s2">high linguistic culture is the struggle for</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.799" end="00:01:51.920" style="s2">culture.  Antonenko</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.799" end="00:01:55.079" style="s2">Davydovych then lists that</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.920" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">scientists, linguists, writers, journalists,</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.079" end="00:02:01.259" style="s2">teachers must work to ensure that</p>

<p begin="00:02:01.259" end="00:02:06.180" style="s2">on speaking Ukrainian, writing in</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.479" end="00:02:09.000" style="s2">Ukrainian, articulating it so that</p>

<p begin="00:02:30.239" end="00:02:34.260" style="s2">words and the right wording, here it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.099" end="00:02:36.780" style="s2">not only about the correct pronunciation, although it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.260" end="00:02:40.220" style="s2">primarily about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.780" end="00:02:42.900" style="s2">in the public space</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.220" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">since independence, the Ukrainian language</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.900" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">began</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:50.360" style="s2">to appear actively not so long ago at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:53.580" style="s2">legislative level, it began  to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.360" end="00:02:56.580" style="s2">first regulate the law of 2006,</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.580" end="00:02:56.580" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.379" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">worked to ensure that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.319" end="00:03:06.060" style="s2">Ukrainian language dubbing appeared in all movie theaters</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">, and then the next step. This was the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.060" end="00:03:12.659" style="s2">year 2021, January 16, a law that we often</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:15.480" style="s2">refer to when it comes to the Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.659" end="00:03:18.659" style="s2">language in public space and once upon</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.480" end="00:03:20.580" style="s2">a time  Last year, in the summer,</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.659" end="00:03:24.300" style="s2">Bohdana and I went to a trendy</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.580" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">new establishment in Podil. We sat, drank</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.300" end="00:03:29.819" style="s2">wine and ate something for a while. It was great, we had a great</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:33.360" style="s2">conversation, but there was one problem. We were</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.819" end="00:03:36.540" style="s2">served in Russian, and Bohdana and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.360" end="00:03:39.060" style="s2">were very determined, so we got up and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.540" end="00:03:41.640" style="s2">approached the administrator.  who</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.060" end="00:03:44.040" style="s2">asked the question why your institution does not</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.640" end="00:03:46.260" style="s2">comply with the law on language,</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.040" end="00:03:48.900" style="s2">some administrator tried so hard to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.260" end="00:03:50.940" style="s2">avoid the answer and there</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.900" end="00:03:52.620" style="s2">will be millions of such stories who started to say Well, you</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.940" end="00:03:55.739" style="s2">understand, we work with older</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.620" end="00:03:57.420" style="s2">people, the average age of a waiter is 20 years, we</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.739" end="00:03:59.879" style="s2">work with older people, it is so</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.420" end="00:04:02.299" style="s2">difficult for them to transition and  some more</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.879" end="00:04:05.939" style="s2">blah blah blah in the end We didn&#39;t hear</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.299" end="00:04:09.120" style="s2">any position</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.939" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">but left  there can be a million such stories and I am</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.120" end="00:04:13.860" style="s2">sure that there are a million of them because the law</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.280" end="00:04:14.900" style="s2">on speech in public space is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.860" end="00:04:17.160" style="s2">enforced</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.900" end="00:04:19.259" style="s2">Bohdana here should be either some</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.160" end="00:04:21.419" style="s2">example from your life or something else you have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.259" end="00:04:23.639" style="s2">pick it up somehow I have a few</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.419" end="00:04:25.020" style="s2">corrections because the listeners are prompt So for</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.639" end="00:04:27.600" style="s2">now  without a name, they know that I have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.020" end="00:04:30.060" style="s2">legal education and I still want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.600" end="00:04:33.660" style="s2">say that we also have the Constitution of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.060" end="00:04:37.160" style="s2">Ukraine, this is a document from the year 1996, in which</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.660" end="00:04:40.800" style="s2">the Ukrainian language is said quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.160" end="00:04:43.560" style="s2">succinctly, article 10 speaks the state</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.800" end="00:04:48.020" style="s2">language in Ukraine, there is a Ukrainian language, full</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.560" end="00:04:51.000" style="s2">stop  about the provision of this language,</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.020" end="00:04:53.699" style="s2">and the problem is that we really</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.000" end="00:04:55.740" style="s2">did not have legislation for a very long time. We would</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.699" end="00:04:58.020" style="s2">decide what this provision should look like</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.740" end="00:05:00.900" style="s2">, and the law on the language was</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.020" end="00:05:02.940" style="s2">adopted as far back as the 19th year, but</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.900" end="00:05:05.880" style="s2">its individual provisions</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.940" end="00:05:09.000" style="s2">gradually came into force, and</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.880" end="00:05:11.639" style="s2">that is why we  for a very long time, for example, we have not seen a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.000" end="00:05:13.740" style="s2">Ukrainian gloss in Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.639" end="00:05:15.300" style="s2">today it sounds paradoxical And in</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.740" end="00:05:17.940" style="s2">some ways even funny Ukrainian gloss in</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.300" end="00:05:21.419" style="s2">Russian  But</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.940" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">it was a very staged process and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.419" end="00:05:25.979" style="s2">tried to see what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:28.320" style="s2">history of this Article 10 of the Constitution of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.979" end="00:05:30.060" style="s2">Ukraine was in general, because it would seem that we have said everything: the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:33.300" style="s2">Constitution of Ukraine, the state language is</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.060" end="00:05:35.340" style="s2">Ukrainian. It is one, but there were even</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.300" end="00:05:38.759" style="s2">several decisions of the Constitutional Court</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.340" end="00:05:41.539" style="s2">Regarding this  articles, and one of them was</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.759" end="00:05:45.120" style="s2">precisely the complaints of people&#39;s deputies about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.539" end="00:05:47.160" style="s2">non-use of the Ukrainian language by people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.120" end="00:05:50.220" style="s2">perform state functions, that is,</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.160" end="00:05:51.900" style="s2">most likely other deputies, or that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.220" end="00:05:54.539" style="s2">want to talk for a very long time about all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.900" end="00:05:57.060" style="s2">legal nuances, but I am happy that</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.539" end="00:06:01.560" style="s2">when we talk with you today and that  there is an</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.060" end="00:06:03.840" style="s2">episode that will be released on August 23, on the Day of the State</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.560" end="00:06:05.819" style="s2">Flag of Ukraine and on the eve of Ukrainian Independence Day.</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.840" end="00:06:08.819" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:06:05.819" end="00:06:12.120" style="s2">I think that for most of our listeners it</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.819" end="00:06:13.800" style="s2">will sound simply absurd. That is, we</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.120" end="00:06:14.780" style="s2">are talking about some archaisms when we</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.800" end="00:06:17.419" style="s2">talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.780" end="00:06:19.680" style="s2">efforts of the Russian language, about</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.419" end="00:06:22.020" style="s2">service in the Russian language, about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.680" end="00:06:24.900" style="s2">Russian language in literature about</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.020" end="00:06:27.780" style="s2">the Russian language in the press, in the media, so</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.900" end="00:06:30.900" style="s2">certain things are left  Yes, but I am convinced</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.780" end="00:06:33.000" style="s2">that the further they go, the more atevistic,</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.900" end="00:06:35.520" style="s2">outdated and not modern they</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.000" end="00:06:38.280" style="s2">will look, but it is important to say that this</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.520" end="00:06:40.259" style="s2">was not always the case and until recently it was completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.280" end="00:06:42.539" style="s2">different, Bohdana, I am glad when your</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.259" end="00:06:46.500" style="s2">legal education is useful to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.539" end="00:06:50.520" style="s2">you and me. How am I, Bohdana, but</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.500" end="00:06:53.520" style="s2">still despite that  that the war is going on, and discussions are going</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.520" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">on for some reason, for some reason, discussions are going</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.520" end="00:07:00.240" style="s2">on about this language Is she alone or is she</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.319" end="00:07:04.380" style="s2">not alone, although you and I know the answer</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.240" end="00:07:07.199" style="s2">and in particular This is a discussion about two</p>

<p begin="00:07:19.560" end="00:07:25.560" style="s2">quarantine, and then I had different stars come to our lessons and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.580" end="00:07:28.199" style="s2">taught Ukrainian literature lessons</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.560" end="00:07:29.880" style="s2">so that they would sit</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.199" end="00:07:31.740" style="s2">instead of children, and once there was even such a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.880" end="00:07:33.840" style="s2">show on Nova  channels,</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.740" end="00:07:35.759" style="s2">episodes of a fifth grader are smarter, well, in a word, the essence of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.840" end="00:07:37.919" style="s2">presence of the stars was for them</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.759" end="00:07:39.960" style="s2">to prove that No, they are not smarter than</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.919" end="00:07:43.380" style="s2">fifth graders  it was just a joke</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.960" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">, they didn&#39;t laugh at it, and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.380" end="00:07:49.080" style="s2">Masha Yefrosinina and Olya Polyakova came to see me.</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:51.900" style="s2">Masha Yefrosi, at Lesya Ukrainka&#39;s lesson on the forest song, was</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.080" end="00:07:55.259" style="s2">very moved by</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.900" end="00:07:57.660" style="s2">Mavka&#39;s fate and was very confused by everything she was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.259" end="00:07:59.639" style="s2">, and then she saw what</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.660" end="00:08:01.620" style="s2">I had  I had many other books with</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.639" end="00:08:03.960" style="s2">me, we are not blunt studies of Ukrainian poetry from</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.620" end="00:08:06.539" style="s2">the Baba Galamaga publishing house, some other</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.960" end="00:08:07.979" style="s2">books that I used, from which I</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.539" end="00:08:10.819" style="s2">read in class, she took photos of all these books,</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.979" end="00:08:13.740" style="s2">she made stories, she</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.819" end="00:08:15.479" style="s2">wanted to buy them and asked me to</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.740" end="00:08:17.099" style="s2">drop her where they can be purchased and  so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.479" end="00:08:18.900" style="s2">similar and if there was such a lively,</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.099" end="00:08:21.180" style="s2">cool dialogue, she was so interested in</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.900" end="00:08:23.819" style="s2">what to interest Olya Polyakova, it was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.180" end="00:08:26.840" style="s2">more difficult question because why did you choose I</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.819" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">chose what the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.840" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">Sentimental Poetry of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:35.459" style="s2">Mykola Voronyi program offered to me Mykola Voronyi is just a</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:39.839" style="s2">good poet for Olya Polyakova because he is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.459" end="00:08:42.899" style="s2">simple rhythmic  lyrics, you can imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.839" end="00:08:44.820" style="s2">you, when you dance or sing on stage,</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.899" end="00:08:46.380" style="s2">you also have a certain rhythm. Well, in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.820" end="00:08:49.019" style="s2">case of</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.380" end="00:08:52.740" style="s2">M  it worked for Voronoi, too, or it did</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.019" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">n&#39;t work because Olya Polyakova was very</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.740" end="00:08:57.899" style="s2">enthusiastic and our lesson lasted 12</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:09:00.360" style="s2">minutes longer than it should have, of course, then it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.899" end="00:09:02.820" style="s2">cut short, but she was impressed, she</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.360" end="00:09:05.360" style="s2">wanted to read more of these texts, I believed</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.820" end="00:09:09.300" style="s2">that maybe she would put, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.360" end="00:09:12.080" style="s2">about the eyes of the night  to the music, but it didn&#39;t happen,</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.300" end="00:09:15.360" style="s2">but it&#39;s still ahead.</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.080" end="00:09:17.040" style="s2">Actually, then it seemed to me that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:19.560" style="s2">these two young ladies are answering in</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.040" end="00:09:21.240" style="s2">Ukrainian, they&#39;re singing in Ukrainian,</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.560" end="00:09:23.880" style="s2">they&#39;re preparing some product in Ukrainian,</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.240" end="00:09:25.680" style="s2">but a video appears, raise your hand. Who</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.880" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">understands what kind of scandal we&#39;re talking about now?</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.680" end="00:09:30.899" style="s2">for those who do not understand for this</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.040" end="00:09:34.700" style="s2">minority, but we will explain because this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.899" end="00:09:37.019" style="s2">show business news, we have such a function to explain</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.700" end="00:09:39.600" style="s2">Masha Yefrosinina and Olya Polyakova have</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.019" end="00:09:41.880" style="s2">their own YouTube show, which has half a million</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.600" end="00:09:44.220" style="s2">subscribers, and in this YouTube show they</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.880" end="00:09:46.080" style="s2">continue to host it in Russian, they</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.220" end="00:09:48.660" style="s2">are being hated  in the comments, how does it</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.080" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">happen, and at some point they recorded a</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.660" end="00:09:54.360" style="s2">video message about the fact that we will not</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:56.940" style="s2">switch to Ukrainian, because we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.360" end="00:09:59.100" style="s2">several arguments, firstly, we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.940" end="00:10:02.339" style="s2">express our emotions in Ukrainian, this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.100" end="00:10:05.459" style="s2">already absurd, and secondly, because this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.339" end="00:10:07.560" style="s2">a conversation between two girlfriends in the kitchen.</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.459" end="00:10:10.500" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:10:07.560" end="00:10:12.839" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:10:10.500" end="00:10:16.019" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:10:12.839" end="00:10:19.140" style="s2">speak as we want in whatever language we want</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.019" end="00:10:21.180" style="s2">and there is no need to try to limit us</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.140" end="00:10:24.060" style="s2">but they forget that they are</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.180" end="00:10:26.339" style="s2">media persons their channel of communication</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.060" end="00:10:27.980" style="s2">Even if it is private YouTube and is not</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.339" end="00:10:30.779" style="s2">closed to a limited circle of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.980" end="00:10:33.600" style="s2">users but open it is also a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.779" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">public sphere and it also obliges</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.600" end="00:10:38.700" style="s2">to implement the law on language, God bless you, do you</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:40.800" style="s2">want to comment? I want to do it.</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.700" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">Finally, you commented, you</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.800" end="00:10:44.279" style="s2">want to ask me a question for the second time. And I still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:47.519" style="s2">understand. What is your attitude, because you</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.279" end="00:10:49.260" style="s2">very sympathetically described to us your</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.519" end="00:10:51.060" style="s2">experience of working with Olya Polakovka</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.260" end="00:10:55.620" style="s2">Mashina Efrosinina. Now I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.060" end="00:10:58.680" style="s2">do you sympathize with them Do you want to speak out</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.620" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">against I sympathize with us that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.680" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">observe such</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.420" end="00:11:07.380" style="s2">inexperienced  unknown persons</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.040" end="00:11:09.079" style="s2">spend so much time on our TV</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.380" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">screens and YouTube screens,</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.079" end="00:11:16.140" style="s2">because in her video, Emma</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:18.260" style="s2">Antonyuk on the channel Palaye M. Antonyuk communicated very well</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.140" end="00:11:20.579" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:11:18.260" end="00:11:24.899" style="s2">exactly this problem, the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.579" end="00:11:27.180" style="s2">problem of these two gentlemen about the fact that there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.899" end="00:11:30.260" style="s2">linguistic needs of Ukrainian-speaking</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.180" end="00:11:32.480" style="s2">Ukrainians, and therefore Russified Ukrainians</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.260" end="00:11:34.640" style="s2">must</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.480" end="00:11:36.779" style="s2">satisfy the needs of</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.640" end="00:11:38.459" style="s2">Ukrainian-speakers  You see Ukrainians so</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.779" end="00:11:41.640" style="s2">difficult, said Bohdana. You understood what</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.459" end="00:11:43.820" style="s2">I said. Well, Masha Efrosinina should</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.640" end="00:11:46.440" style="s2">speak Ukrainian. In short, in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.820" end="00:11:49.200" style="s2">public space, my question</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.440" end="00:11:52.279" style="s2">to you is how you feel about this situation.</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.200" end="00:11:54.600" style="s2">And what do you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.279" end="00:11:57.060" style="s2">Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainian space</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.600" end="00:11:59.459" style="s2">around us?</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.060" end="00:12:00.500" style="s2">I generally had two</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.459" end="00:12:04.019" style="s2">reactions, the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.500" end="00:12:06.899" style="s2">first was so uncontrollable and emotional, and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.019" end="00:12:10.139" style="s2">second was already when I steamed up this</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.899" end="00:12:12.120" style="s2">situation a little, and actually this uncontrolled</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.139" end="00:12:14.100" style="s2">reaction was that I thought,</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.120" end="00:12:16.500" style="s2">God, why am I even hearing this, it is very</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.100" end="00:12:19.980" style="s2">obscene Thank you, in general, it is possible today</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.500" end="00:12:22.620" style="s2">in the context of the war in the context  all</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.980" end="00:12:25.339" style="s2">that  about the experience that Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.620" end="00:12:28.920" style="s2">society is going through and, in the end, these two women also</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.339" end="00:12:31.700" style="s2">try to protect the Russian language and</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.920" end="00:12:34.620" style="s2">look for arguments for this. It just</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.700" end="00:12:36.540" style="s2">causes discomfort. And at this moment, when</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.620" end="00:12:39.420" style="s2">you witness something like this, you</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.540" end="00:12:41.399" style="s2">want to somehow leave the room, but then</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.420" end="00:12:44.220" style="s2">I started thinking about  what</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.399" end="00:12:47.639" style="s2">you said is that there are people who just</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.220" end="00:12:51.120" style="s2">privately under anonymous avatars</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.639" end="00:12:53.220" style="s2">express their not always useful thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.120" end="00:12:56.579" style="s2">in their twitters or their tiny</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.220" end="00:12:59.760" style="s2">instagrams. And there is a completely different situation in another</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.579" end="00:13:02.660" style="s2">situation when such speech is conducted by</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.760" end="00:13:05.339" style="s2">people who shape trends because</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.660" end="00:13:07.459" style="s2">certain trends may not be formed</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.339" end="00:13:10.320" style="s2">for you and me, for example, the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.459" end="00:13:12.839" style="s2">stars of Ukrainian show business, but</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.320" end="00:13:16.500" style="s2">they are definitely forming for</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.839" end="00:13:18.420" style="s2">many viewers and listeners in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.500" end="00:13:21.420" style="s2">same Masha Efrosina, this is a very young</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.420" end="00:13:24.420" style="s2">audience and a part of this audience is</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.420" end="00:13:26.940" style="s2">exactly those people, career building is ahead of them,</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.420" end="00:13:29.279" style="s2">not behind, that is, in  Masha</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.940" end="00:13:31.500" style="s2">Yefrosinina has a very specific career on</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.279" end="00:13:34.260" style="s2">television, which created her face,</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.500" end="00:13:37.200" style="s2">brand and image.  I have a career in</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.260" end="00:13:40.699" style="s2">cool projects, and people look at her</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.200" end="00:13:44.940" style="s2">as a model of behavior, as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.699" end="00:13:46.680" style="s2">model from which they can take an example, and they</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.940" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">will think whether I need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.680" end="00:13:50.880" style="s2">practice Ukrainian in order to</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:54.600" style="s2">be successful. Can I, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.880" end="00:13:57.000" style="s2">maneuver or choose Russian?</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.600" end="00:13:58.440" style="s2">who spoke and I was told</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.000" end="00:14:02.100" style="s2">this to you once. In this</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.440" end="00:14:06.300" style="s2">Russian podcast, you can reach a larger</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.100" end="00:14:08.100" style="s2">audience, and this problem is a problem for me</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.300" end="00:14:10.380" style="s2">in general, because it articulates poorly.</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.100" end="00:14:12.180" style="s2">This is what I want</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.380" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">to tell a different story, it will probably also be</p>

<p begin="00:14:54.839" end="00:15:00.540" style="s2">come from. He grew up in the photographs of Sasha Maslova</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.320" end="00:15:03.060" style="s2">wonderful portraits Ivan Dorn is somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.540" end="00:15:06.839" style="s2">depressed with a hunchback and we see that</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.060" end="00:15:08.459" style="s2">he really  thinks very hard about</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.839" end="00:15:11.399" style="s2">his future. Perhaps he is even</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.459" end="00:15:14.100" style="s2">suffering in parallel. A New</p>

<p begin="00:15:36.860" end="00:15:42.899" style="s2">I was incredibly annoyed by this article</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.720" end="00:15:45.420" style="s2">because, in my opinion, it</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.899" end="00:15:48.839" style="s2">describes an absolutely marginal case in the Ukrainian context,</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.420" end="00:15:50.940" style="s2">because we all know that on</p>

<p begin="00:16:17.399" end="00:16:21.540" style="s2">Andrii Khlyvnyuk&#39;s problematic poetry is now, which</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.320" end="00:16:23.579" style="s2">he sometimes shares in his stories. But the</p>

<p begin="00:16:23.579" end="00:16:27.720" style="s2">in the Moscow Bureau, does not consider it appropriate to</p>

<p begin="00:16:27.720" end="00:16:32.220" style="s2">he also does not want to talk to Vakarchuk, who</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.759" end="00:16:34.019" style="s2">at first greatly helped volunteers and the</p>

<p begin="00:16:41.399" end="00:16:46.259" style="s2">mind of Ivan Dorn, and this is a big problem for me.</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.399" end="00:16:48.360" style="s2">When we talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.259" end="00:16:50.880" style="s2">perception of the Ukrainian language and</p>

<p begin="00:17:03.540" end="00:17:07.620" style="s2">quite similar to what I</p>

<p begin="00:20:10.860" end="00:20:18.780" style="s2">all the same, but we apply it to the Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.340" end="00:20:21.960" style="s2">language, too, Ukrainian becomes your</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.780" end="00:20:24.240" style="s2">everyday language, the language of your smartphone, the language of</p>

<p begin="00:20:26.100" end="00:20:31.919" style="s2">am leading to a thesis about  that</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.000" end="00:20:34.799" style="s2">Russified Ukrainians are not to blame for the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.919" end="00:20:38.299" style="s2">they are like that, but they could and should</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.799" end="00:20:43.039" style="s2">make efforts to change  to go on and on</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.299" end="00:20:45.780" style="s2">like this, according to the language principle, the division will still</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.039" end="00:20:49.020" style="s2">take place and it will continue because the language of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.780" end="00:20:52.500" style="s2">Ukrainian state is the Ukrainian</p>

<p begin="00:21:30.720" end="00:21:36.900" style="s2">it&#39;s always career because in many</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.720" end="00:21:39.539" style="s2">areas you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.900" end="00:21:43.440" style="s2">know Ukrainian so perfectly and meticulously to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.539" end="00:21:46.260" style="s2">your job. But for them it can be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.440" end="00:21:49.020" style="s2">private choice related to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.260" end="00:21:51.780" style="s2">Russia attacked Ukraine and the Russian language</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.020" end="00:21:55.940" style="s2">is the language of death  the language of genocide and the language of</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.780" end="00:21:59.520" style="s2">murderers. But it seems to me that very often</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.940" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">we talk about all kinds of crimes  goes from language</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.520" end="00:22:04.860" style="s2">to language as if about something like that, it&#39;s as if he</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.440" end="00:22:08.159" style="s2">clicked with his fingers, so he clicked. And</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.860" end="00:22:10.679" style="s2">that&#39;s not really the case, and it&#39;s also a cliché of</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.159" end="00:22:12.900" style="s2">Russian propaganda that Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.679" end="00:22:16.320" style="s2">is very closely organized, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.900" end="00:22:18.980" style="s2">to Russian, or that it turns out that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.320" end="00:22:21.840" style="s2">not so close for  For many people, it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.980" end="00:22:24.360" style="s2">incredibly difficult to switch from Russian</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.840" end="00:22:27.000" style="s2">to Ukrainian, and for some, it</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.360" end="00:22:30.059" style="s2">can really take years and years to do it,</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.000" end="00:22:33.059" style="s2">and I think that this is also an important topic to</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.059" end="00:22:36.360" style="s2">talk about, that you need practice in</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.059" end="00:22:40.080" style="s2">order for everything to be elastic and beautiful, and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.360" end="00:22:44.840" style="s2">really happens that you speak Russian.</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.080" end="00:22:48.600" style="s2">you could. And Ukrainian is not so. My friend is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.840" end="00:22:50.700" style="s2">fundraiser. He told me recently. He</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.600" end="00:22:53.580" style="s2">switched to Ukrainian a few</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.700" end="00:22:56.039" style="s2">months ago and says, you know. I understand</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.580" end="00:22:58.200" style="s2">that I speak English better than I</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.039" end="00:22:59.820" style="s2">speak Ukrainian now, even though I can</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.200" end="00:23:01.919" style="s2">hear everyday conversation, it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.820" end="00:23:04.919" style="s2">absolutely OK and I  Avzhezh praised him,</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.919" end="00:23:06.720" style="s2">but I caught myself thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.919" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">I had always been like that. I always</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.720" end="00:23:11.820" style="s2">spoke English better than Russian, but for</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:14.460" style="s2">me it was  la some kind of conscious history,</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.820" end="00:23:17.039" style="s2">because I didn’t come across Russian at</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.460" end="00:23:20.159" style="s2">school and at the university anymore, I knew</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.039" end="00:23:23.940" style="s2">it passively and read some literature in it, but it</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.159" end="00:23:26.640" style="s2">was never my language of use on my</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.940" end="00:23:30.539" style="s2">tongue, so I know that I can take it and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.640" end="00:23:32.159" style="s2">speak and now I’m sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.539" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">it would even be easier to</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.159" end="00:23:36.140" style="s2">speak Polish than Russian, but I am leading to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:40.260" style="s2">the point that I am</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.140" end="00:23:43.860" style="s2">ready to understand those who</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.260" end="00:23:46.799" style="s2">really struggle with these processes and it</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.860" end="00:23:49.500" style="s2">is very important to have quite different</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.799" end="00:23:51.380" style="s2">entry points into the language and to understand these possible</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.500" end="00:23:54.720" style="s2">mechanisms, moreover, to see</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.380" end="00:23:57.120" style="s2">success stories  I think it is very</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.720" end="00:23:59.460" style="s2">important that some people share their</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.120" end="00:24:02.640" style="s2">transition stories. Two stories immediately come to mind.</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.460" end="00:24:05.279" style="s2">The first is the story</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.640" end="00:24:09.120" style="s2">of the famous Kyiv architect Balbek,</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.279" end="00:24:10.860" style="s2">who is also slowly transitioning, but he</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.120" end="00:24:12.120" style="s2">tells how he surrounds himself in</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.860" end="00:24:14.640" style="s2">Ukrainian.</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.120" end="00:24:17.279" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:24:14.640" end="00:24:20.700" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.279" end="00:24:23.419" style="s2">consciously chose the Ukrainian language and also</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.700" end="00:24:25.980" style="s2">slowly surrounds himself with it in order to</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.419" end="00:24:28.340" style="s2">enrich his vocabulary  I read</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.980" end="00:24:32.580" style="s2">Ukrainian poetry to</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.340" end="00:24:34.559" style="s2">Bohdan, do you want a coming out? I always</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.580" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">suspect that I will ask Dima to cut it out.</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:39.980" style="s2">But maybe not because it</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:43.100" style="s2">will definitely be preserved for everyone present here</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.980" end="00:24:47.400" style="s2">until the age of 14.</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.100" end="00:24:49.620" style="s2">In my life, there was a Russian language. I</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.400" end="00:24:52.140" style="s2">spoke Russian three times a week.</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.620" end="00:24:54.539" style="s2">When I went to dances, I spoke</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.140" end="00:24:57.059" style="s2">Russian.  with my friends in the yard, I</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.539" end="00:24:59.820" style="s2">spoke in Russian with the godfather and</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.059" end="00:25:02.880" style="s2">godmother and friends of my parents</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.820" end="00:25:06.559" style="s2">who often appeared in my</p>

<p begin="00:25:16.980" end="00:25:22.760" style="s2">Valentina explained to me and explained to us all</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.980" end="00:25:26.760" style="s2">why in this lyceum</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.760" end="00:25:29.880" style="s2">among the rules is to speak only</p>

<p begin="00:25:29.880" end="00:25:38.159" style="s2">What are the ideological foundations on which we are all here?</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.360" end="00:25:40.559" style="s2">What did you call us, the future elite of the nation?</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.559" end="00:25:45.679" style="s2">a common</p>

<p begin="00:25:54.659" end="00:26:01.460" style="s2">rules. I&#39;m a lyceum student of this lyceum who</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.240" end="00:26:24.600" style="s2">that is, you can imagine that there were friends with whom you</p>

<p begin="00:26:24.600" end="00:26:29.700" style="s2">you start speaking Ukrainian. Well, I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.179" end="00:26:32.640" style="s2">be honest, I can&#39;t imagine. That is, I don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:26:56.279" end="00:27:01.200" style="s2">since then the position has not wavered anywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.020" end="00:27:03.779" style="s2">I think that these stories about</p>

<p begin="00:27:59.399" end="00:28:06.659" style="s2">Hello. This is some kind of stupidity</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.899" end="00:28:09.539" style="s2">on much larger examples, it</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.659" end="00:28:11.580" style="s2">can be analyzed from the stories of friends and</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.539" end="00:28:13.860" style="s2">even me. It is a pity that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.580" end="00:28:16.799" style="s2">did not analyze some stories and did not collect them from our</p>

<p begin="00:28:28.200" end="00:28:33.600" style="s2">which inspires me a lot,</p>

<p begin="00:28:36.360" end="00:28:43.440" style="s2">such a huge wave of transitions to the Ukrainian language,</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.940" end="00:28:45.960" style="s2">and I somehow remembered that in the</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.960" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">years ago, there were a lot of people who</p>

<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:55.919" style="s2">chose Ukrainian, and these were not some marginalized people.</p>

<p begin="00:29:23.760" end="00:29:28.620" style="s2">listed, we are talking about whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.279" end="00:29:32.039" style="s2">figures of Ukrainian literature. That is,</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.620" end="00:29:34.860" style="s2">they are people who have enriched it lexically, in particular, even</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.039" end="00:29:37.020" style="s2">now. When I listen to my friends who are</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.860" end="00:29:39.419" style="s2">switching to Ukrainian, then  I understand that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.020" end="00:29:42.779" style="s2">they try this language on their tongue in a completely</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.419" end="00:29:45.260" style="s2">different way than I do and when I am sometimes quite</p>

<p begin="00:29:55.080" end="00:30:00.120" style="s2">will hear it and see how it</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.179" end="00:30:02.520" style="s2">works, and in fact, those people who today,</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.120" end="00:30:05.399" style="s2">especially in the creative class, are switching</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.520" end="00:30:08.399" style="s2">to Ukrainian, they are incredibly enriching</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.860" end="00:30:15.899" style="s2">like it very much, that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.799" end="00:30:18.779" style="s2">watch these people with interest because,</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.899" end="00:30:21.000" style="s2">again, I understand what they will add to</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.779" end="00:30:23.899" style="s2">this language and eventually add to me as a</p>

<p begin="00:31:48.419" end="00:31:53.159" style="s2">Malkovich knew what he was writing about and when he</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.419" end="00:31:56.580" style="s2">worked as an editor in a publishing house in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.159" end="00:31:59.519" style="s2">youth of the 80s, he also understood the place of</p>

<p begin="00:31:59.519" end="00:32:06.059" style="s2">Russified Kyiv and Well, to pretend that he</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.419" end="00:32:07.980" style="s2">was not like this Kyiv is spitting in one&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:32:12.080" end="00:32:16.500" style="s2">Listen, I recently reread a fairy tale that</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.820" end="00:32:19.260" style="s2">I really liked in my childhood</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.500" end="00:32:20.940" style="s2">by Ivan Malkovich, which</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.260" end="00:32:25.500" style="s2">is called  the golden spider is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.940" end="00:32:28.860" style="s2">short fairy tale. And this is a fairy tale that</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.500" end="00:32:32.100" style="s2">tells about a very happy</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.860" end="00:32:34.559" style="s2">family. One day, the father of this family goes</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.100" end="00:32:36.740" style="s2">to war with them because his country was</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.559" end="00:32:38.940" style="s2">attacked by the Northern neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.740" end="00:32:42.179" style="s2">from childhood. I don&#39;t remember this</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.940" end="00:32:45.419" style="s2">fragment, but when I reread it,</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.179" end="00:32:47.039" style="s2">I think  his lords, that is, in the 90s,</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.419" end="00:32:49.559" style="s2">Malkovich, having founded the publishing house</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.039" end="00:32:52.799" style="s2">Ababagalamaga, thought that such a</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.559" end="00:32:55.500" style="s2">small Bohdan should put into his head the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.799" end="00:32:58.140" style="s2">idea that there is a Northern neighbor.</p>

<p begin="00:33:04.019" end="00:33:10.460" style="s2">there are generally nice children&#39;s texts</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.600" end="00:33:15.000" style="s2">that have, well, we can say today such</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.460" end="00:33:16.799" style="s2">an absolutely patriotic direction, and it is another</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.000" end="00:33:19.080" style="s2">matter that this is a patriotic direction.</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.799" end="00:33:21.659" style="s2">Also, in our country, it was often branded as</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.080" end="00:33:24.539" style="s2">some kind of excessive or obscene, but it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.659" end="00:33:26.340" style="s2">just a normal preventive one, and it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.539" end="00:33:28.799" style="s2">not even necessarily an occasion to think, because a child</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.340" end="00:33:31.860" style="s2">will not sit and think about it,</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.799" end="00:33:34.200" style="s2">but the child will remember it and the child will</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.860" end="00:33:36.240" style="s2">remember, say, some illustrations  or</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.200" end="00:33:39.720" style="s2">what is in this Golden Spider I remember</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.240" end="00:33:42.659" style="s2">the war is over we won dad</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.720" end="00:33:45.240" style="s2">came home And brought a gift he</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.659" end="00:33:47.880" style="s2">came back for Christmas Eve when the family is</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.240" end="00:33:51.419" style="s2">sitting really without money and</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.880" end="00:33:54.179" style="s2">no way Set the table and everything is fine Everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.419" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">should be fine I like it very much</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.179" end="00:33:58.919" style="s2">this is the coding of the space that Malkovich does,</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:34:00.779" style="s2">and listen, let&#39;s talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.919" end="00:34:03.600" style="s2">coding of the Ukrainian-speaking space,</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.779" end="00:34:06.480" style="s2">because a lot of people today</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.600" end="00:34:09.780" style="s2">remember Ivan Malkovich as such a key</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.480" end="00:34:12.720" style="s2">figure for this, because in many</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.780" end="00:34:14.599" style="s2">cities of Ukraine, for a very long time,</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.720" end="00:34:16.859" style="s2">ababagalamag books could be the only</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.599" end="00:34:19.740" style="s2">Ukrainian-language publications that a</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.859" end="00:34:21.780" style="s2">child could buy  and Malkovich took the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.740" end="00:34:23.820" style="s2">they were the most beautiful and Dityna simply</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.780" end="00:34:25.859" style="s2">pointed with her fingers and said I want this</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.820" end="00:34:28.740" style="s2">Snow Queen I want the alphabet I want my</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.859" end="00:34:30.960" style="s2">favorite poems or there was such a series of</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.740" end="00:34:32.579" style="s2">happily small books for hryvnia that</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.960" end="00:34:34.859" style="s2">everyone could afford, they</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.579" end="00:34:37.560" style="s2">were sold at Ukrposhta, even people from the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.859" end="00:34:42.419" style="s2">Crimea or from  Luhansk remember that they</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.560" end="00:34:44.399" style="s2">were always these books And this would  sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.419" end="00:34:47.220" style="s2">not the only way to immerse yourself in the Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.399" end="00:34:49.200" style="s2">language. What else do you think about? You started</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.220" end="00:34:51.500" style="s2">talking about how Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.200" end="00:34:54.179" style="s2">film dubbing appeared, it also seems</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.500" end="00:34:56.820" style="s2">epochal to me. And you shouldn&#39;t underestimate this,</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.179" end="00:34:58.800" style="s2">because everyone talked for a long time about the fact that, well,</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.820" end="00:35:02.040" style="s2">what kind of cinema in Ukrainian  dub a</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:04.680" style="s2">movie in Ukrainian, what? And Oleksa</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.040" end="00:35:07.980" style="s2">Negrebetskyi came and everything just flowed in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.680" end="00:35:10.380" style="s2">same way in Ukrainian. It seemed to me that it should</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.980" end="00:35:12.359" style="s2">have been, for example, Esquier magazine when</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.380" end="00:35:14.760" style="s2">it appeared in Ukraine.</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.359" end="00:35:17.940" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:35:14.760" end="00:35:20.760" style="s2">in Ukrainian, when I</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.940" end="00:35:23.700" style="s2">bought it, then this first issue</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.760" end="00:35:26.220" style="s2">was a wonder for me too, that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.700" end="00:35:29.820" style="s2">in the Ukrainian media space,</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.220" end="00:35:32.220" style="s2">a square finally appeared, and what is it, Square, in</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.820" end="00:35:36.320" style="s2">what positions will it be in the Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.220" end="00:35:40.260" style="s2">space? Well, I think that it should be here</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.320" end="00:35:41.940" style="s2">The passage about the renaming of streets, but I</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.260" end="00:35:43.800" style="s2">think that we will benefit from this</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.940" end="00:35:46.260" style="s2">Bohdan, did you vote in Kyiv</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.800" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">digitally for the renaming of streets in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.260" end="00:35:52.140" style="s2">city of Kyiv Yes, I confess, ches  but I</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.960" end="00:35:54.599" style="s2">didn&#39;t vote because there were 300 names, more than 300,</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.140" end="00:35:57.060" style="s2">it was too much, that is, because I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.599" end="00:36:00.079" style="s2">just point my finger at any name.</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.060" end="00:36:03.359" style="s2">I also googled who the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.079" end="00:36:05.940" style="s2">expert commission advises. And who was the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.359" end="00:36:08.640" style="s2">finalist, because the choice had to be conscious  And</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.940" end="00:36:11.940" style="s2">this renaming had to be aware of this in</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.640" end="00:36:14.339" style="s2">order to understand what kind of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.940" end="00:36:16.740" style="s2">certain people had with these places, it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.339" end="00:36:20.119" style="s2">also very important to have this link.</p>

<p begin="00:36:28.079" end="00:36:34.980" style="s2">very, very cool opportunity it was. To be honest,</p>

<p begin="00:36:39.320" end="00:36:45.300" style="s2">to stop being the clichéd city of Mikhail</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.420" end="00:36:48.060" style="s2">Bulgakov and to be the city of Valerian</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.300" end="00:36:50.400" style="s2">Pidmogilny. For us, Kyiv has long been the</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.060" end="00:36:54.180" style="s2">city of Valerian Pidmogilny, but he</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.400" end="00:36:57.060" style="s2">in our opinion, it should become so for everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.180" end="00:36:59.579" style="s2">in popular culture in particular, and if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.060" end="00:37:01.800" style="s2">cut it short, they dismantled the board from the</p>

<p begin="00:37:08.280" end="00:37:11.060" style="s2">these are already details,</p>

<p begin="00:37:14.460" end="00:37:19.500" style="s2">because it encodes our space, we walk down one</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.220" end="00:37:21.720" style="s2">street and go to another, and when this</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.500" end="00:37:23.700" style="s2">street is Chervonoarmiiska, there is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.720" end="00:37:26.040" style="s2">certain dissonance, just like with</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.700" end="00:37:28.859" style="s2">Elenyana Street  but if we delve further, then</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.040" end="00:37:31.440" style="s2">Lermontov or Turgenev. Let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.859" end="00:37:34.500" style="s2">about popular culture, because this is what</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.440" end="00:37:36.599" style="s2">really Ukrainianizes the space and Ukrainianizes</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.500" end="00:37:39.020" style="s2">everyone, because it normalizes the Ukrainian language,</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.599" end="00:37:42.839" style="s2">again, many people remember the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.020" end="00:37:46.440" style="s2">Ukrainian-speaking period 1+1 as a time when</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.839" end="00:37:48.900" style="s2">you wanted to do everything in this language  because the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.440" end="00:37:52.140" style="s2">pluses were so cool that you wanted to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.900" end="00:37:54.839" style="s2">like on television and agreed on</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.140" end="00:37:56.940" style="s2">magazines. It is also very important to me</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.839" end="00:37:59.880" style="s2">that today the gloss will be in Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.940" end="00:38:02.700" style="s2">because for a very long time we understood that,</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.880" end="00:38:05.640" style="s2">for example, we cannot read about fashion in</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.700" end="00:38:07.740" style="s2">Ukrainian simply because there are no</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.640" end="00:38:09.540" style="s2">materials about Ukrainian fashion  there are the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.740" end="00:38:10.980" style="s2">best glossy magazines, they were</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.540" end="00:38:13.140" style="s2">Russian-language.</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.980" end="00:38:16.440" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:38:13.140" end="00:38:19.140" style="s2">and to the music with what</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.440" end="00:38:21.960" style="s2">creak they went, so there were a lot of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.140" end="00:38:25.260" style="s2">about what they were saying. But how much of this music</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.960" end="00:38:27.660" style="s2">and no one will type it, but it was a</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.260" end="00:38:29.760" style="s2">question of the market, and a lot of players</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.660" end="00:38:33.440" style="s2">just started making content in Ukrainian.</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.760" end="00:38:37.619" style="s2">Because they accept this question of the market, and</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.440" end="00:38:38.599" style="s2">I think that in fact  very cool, when there is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.619" end="00:38:42.180" style="s2">regulator,</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.599" end="00:38:43.940" style="s2">you and I talked about such emotional</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.180" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">things for quite a long time.</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.940" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:53.160" style="s2"></p>

<p begin="00:38:57.359" end="00:39:01.820" style="s2">the attitude towards him</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:05.640" style="s2">if you are not a lawyer in constitutional law is</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.820" end="00:39:09.060" style="s2">not easy to say the least, but when there is a law,</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.640" end="00:39:11.280" style="s2">there is a norm that regulates certain</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.060" end="00:39:13.800" style="s2">legal relations. For example, when we children</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.280" end="00:39:17.940" style="s2">were sitting in a Kyiv restaurant and understood</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.800" end="00:39:20.099" style="s2">that we had a question about the language of service, it</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.940" end="00:39:22.619" style="s2">was not  our Quirk and we did not have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.099" end="00:39:26.099" style="s2">overcome internal discomfort due to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.619" end="00:39:28.859" style="s2">a person who speaks Russian because it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.099" end="00:39:32.760" style="s2">her native language and she probably has the</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.859" end="00:39:35.820" style="s2">right  I am happy that this law is</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.760" end="00:39:38.220" style="s2">in effect, that its provisions are consistently</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.820" end="00:39:40.859" style="s2">coming into force, and that a certain</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.220" end="00:39:43.320" style="s2">framework is emerging in which the Ukrainian language functions,</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.859" end="00:39:45.359" style="s2">because of course, when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.320" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">literature, when we talk about music,</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.359" end="00:39:50.300" style="s2">we are talking about something very private, what is</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:52.560" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.300" end="00:39:54.540" style="s2">from the inside, and even if you choose,</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.560" end="00:39:56.700" style="s2">for example, Ukrainian as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.540" end="00:39:59.400" style="s2">Russian, it is still an internal</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.700" end="00:40:02.280" style="s2">choice, but when it comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.400" end="00:40:05.540" style="s2">public sphere, there must be</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.280" end="00:40:08.520" style="s2">this framework, otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.540" end="00:40:11.640" style="s2">conflicts begin, simply</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.520" end="00:40:15.000" style="s2">solving questions begins.</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.640" end="00:40:18.240" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.000" end="00:40:20.280" style="s2">came and which simply did not exist, which will greatly</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.240" end="00:40:22.819" style="s2">affect the space around us, you</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.280" end="00:40:26.220" style="s2">started talking about the Ukrainian language in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.819" end="00:40:27.660" style="s2">space around And I thought about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.220" end="00:40:29.460" style="s2">the group Vremya y Steklo only had</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.660" end="00:40:32.099" style="s2">one song in the Ukrainian language and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.460" end="00:40:35.819" style="s2">broke up, they are not related to each other  things,</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.099" end="00:40:38.599" style="s2">but it is good that it took place, well, that is,</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.819" end="00:40:40.740" style="s2">they already got on the radio according to quotas,</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.599" end="00:40:44.000" style="s2">I would like everyone to get on the radio,</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.740" end="00:40:46.859" style="s2">we  and quotas,</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.000" end="00:40:49.079" style="s2">but maybe I will make a lesson aside to another</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.859" end="00:40:51.300" style="s2">question, a question that we were asked at</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.079" end="00:40:54.060" style="s2">our Kyiv Laiv, and then we</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.300" end="00:40:56.339" style="s2">promised that we will have an episode about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.060" end="00:40:59.579" style="s2">language soon, we will definitely talk about it,</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.339" end="00:41:02.700" style="s2">about the transition to Ukrainian,</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.579" end="00:41:04.800" style="s2">such a pressing question, what is the topic, what is the topic</p>

<p begin="00:42:59.880" end="00:43:06.900" style="s2">look at the prose and choose what you</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.260" end="00:43:11.160" style="s2">like, because there will be detective stories and</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.900" end="00:43:13.380" style="s2">romance novels, and it is very difficult.</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.160" end="00:43:15.660" style="s2">multi-layered literature there you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.380" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">find very different texts and most of</p>

<p begin="00:45:25.319" end="00:45:30.720" style="s2">which novel Andruhovich should start with</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.200" end="00:45:33.180" style="s2">that when you are asked for</p>

<p begin="00:45:42.420" end="00:45:47.760" style="s2">novel is very reminiscent of some things</p>

<p begin="00:45:47.760" end="00:45:53.400" style="s2">seems to me. And in this novel there is simply</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.079" end="00:45:55.500" style="s2">an amazing feeling of a carnival and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.400" end="00:45:58.020" style="s2">opportunity to change the language is also an</p>

<p begin="00:45:58.020" end="00:46:03.839" style="s2">and sometimes even  my image, and that&#39;s why I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.380" end="00:46:05.940" style="s2">many people will recognize themselves in the recreations. Who</p>

<p begin="00:50:23.400" end="00:50:29.760" style="s2">great  because I recently looked at the</p>

<p begin="00:50:37.619" end="00:50:42.980" style="s2">because it somehow happened that you</p>

<p begin="00:51:02.900" end="00:51:09.000" style="s2">But why do we devote more than</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.359" end="00:51:11.700" style="s2">an hour to it in our conversation, why do we still</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.000" end="00:51:13.859" style="s2">talk about it if there is really a supposed framework</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.700" end="00:51:16.440" style="s2">that defines it, why is it important for us to feel the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.859" end="00:51:18.240" style="s2">continuation of meanings or to</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.440" end="00:51:22.140" style="s2">say those things that were</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.240" end="00:51:24.800" style="s2">said sometimes 100  - 150 years ago in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.140" end="00:51:29.160" style="s2">context of the Ukrainian language. Today is</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.800" end="00:51:31.859" style="s2">2022, because we are doing a podcast with you</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.160" end="00:51:34.440" style="s2">about culture today and when</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.859" end="00:51:37.040" style="s2">we started doing this podcast in March.</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.440" end="00:51:41.579" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:51:37.040" end="00:51:44.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:51:41.579" end="00:51:48.359" style="s2">After the war,</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.960" end="00:51:50.640" style="s2">we realized this and now we are starting</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.359" end="00:51:52.980" style="s2">to live in a new space that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.640" end="00:51:54.720" style="s2">are trying to clean  from everything that</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.980" end="00:51:57.960" style="s2">it should have been cleansed of. Long ago,</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.720" end="00:52:00.839" style="s2">you and I talked about decolonization from the traces of imperialism,</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.960" end="00:52:03.540" style="s2">but in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.839" end="00:52:05.540" style="s2">comments on Facebook, the historian Sasha</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.540" end="00:52:07.940" style="s2">Alfyorov very nicely wrote about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.540" end="00:52:11.760" style="s2">usually</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.940" end="00:52:15.420" style="s2">colonies were much less developed than</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.760" end="00:52:17.700" style="s2">metropolises, and therefore you can still argue</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.420" end="00:52:20.880" style="s2">with the fact that Ukraine  - it really was a</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.700" end="00:52:24.240" style="s2">colony, so it is more appropriate to use the</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.880" end="00:52:26.640" style="s2">term de-internalization, and I also</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.240" end="00:52:29.400" style="s2">really like this idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.640" end="00:52:33.319" style="s2">start where the Empire realizes its</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.400" end="00:52:37.640" style="s2">space, its consciousness, its</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.319" end="00:52:40.680" style="s2">lists of literature and its libraries,</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.640" end="00:52:43.260" style="s2">where to Russify</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.680" end="00:52:45.720" style="s2">And actually this whole process also perceives Language</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.260" end="00:52:47.880" style="s2">- this is one of those points Maybe  even</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.720" end="00:52:50.460" style="s2">our whole podcast should start</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.880" end="00:52:52.680" style="s2">We should talk about the anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.460" end="00:52:54.900" style="s2">suitcase so that we put it in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.680" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">sculptural heritage and the next step</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.900" end="00:52:58.260" style="s2">is language because Language is the first thing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:53:00.300" style="s2">got into our cultural suitcase</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.260" end="00:53:03.660" style="s2">not even like that This is some basis of this</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.300" end="00:53:05.760" style="s2">cultural suitcase  the material from which this</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.660" end="00:53:09.020" style="s2">suitcase is sewn, and then talk about everything</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.760" end="00:53:11.280" style="s2">else, but m  and really postponed this episode</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.020" end="00:53:14.819" style="s2">consciously for the end Because we needed</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.280" end="00:53:18.240" style="s2">to grow those lean muscles and</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.819" end="00:53:21.000" style="s2">find out a lot of other questions until you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.240" end="00:53:24.319" style="s2">believe it, but I also thought about the beginning and</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.000" end="00:53:26.520" style="s2">about the anxious suitcase because in fact</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.319" end="00:53:28.099" style="s2">it was easiest to start today&#39;s conversation</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.520" end="00:53:30.900" style="s2">with this</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.099" end="00:53:33.180" style="s2">most famous  probably the phrases of Hera</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.900" end="00:53:36.059" style="s2">&#39;s guide about the fact that Language is the home of existence</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.180" end="00:53:38.280" style="s2">and Well, we all know it. It sounds good,</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.059" end="00:53:40.940" style="s2">you can start it on Twitter, but if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.280" end="00:53:45.540" style="s2">start digging into it, then</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.940" end="00:53:48.660" style="s2">24 we all began to look at our home and</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.540" end="00:53:51.000" style="s2">think that we can take from there what we</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.660" end="00:53:53.400" style="s2">can we save from it what can we</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.000" end="00:53:57.440" style="s2">save if the house is destroyed what to do with a</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.400" end="00:53:57.440" style="s2">destroyed house and</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.619" end="00:54:03.180" style="s2">we want this house to be Ukrainian and</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.480" end="00:54:05.460" style="s2">if it is Ukrainian then it is in</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.180" end="00:54:08.220" style="s2">Ukrainian We named a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.460" end="00:54:10.260" style="s2">different things today and</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.220" end="00:54:13.740" style="s2">you will find about all these vocations in the description of our</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.260" end="00:54:17.339" style="s2">episode  and on YouTube, Spotify, Apple, Google</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.740" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">podcast and everywhere else, we ask you to put</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.339" end="00:54:22.980" style="s2">stars, leave comments, stay</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:25.800" style="s2">with us, we just read them later</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.980" end="00:54:27.960" style="s2">For example, we learn about how our</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.800" end="00:54:30.660" style="s2">listeners do not consider Mykola Gogol a</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.960" end="00:54:33.119" style="s2">Ukrainian writer, and we are interested in that.</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.660" end="00:54:35.220" style="s2">Because we do not do this prompt. For the two of us, we</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.119" end="00:54:38.940" style="s2">really want this dialogue.</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.220" end="00:54:41.640" style="s2">Because only then is a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.940" end="00:54:43.619" style="s2">understanding of Ukrainian culture born. Well, in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.640" end="00:54:46.099" style="s2">context of our conversation today, I</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.619" end="00:54:49.079" style="s2">I really want</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.099" end="00:54:53.940" style="s2">our common home with you to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.079" end="00:54:56.040" style="s2">truly Ukrainian and I am convinced that we are all taking</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.940" end="00:54:58.440" style="s2">a lot of steps to</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.040" end="00:55:01.579" style="s2">make it really happen. Nastya,</p>
