<p begin="00:00:19.380" end="00:00:23.480" style="s2">untitled, and Bohdana Neborak and Nastya</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.420" end="00:00:27.779" style="s2">Evdokymova met again</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.480" end="00:00:30.720" style="s2">in the audio lounge for the 18th time in the 18th</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.779" end="00:00:33.239" style="s2">episode, in which we talk about the city of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.720" end="00:00:36.000" style="s2">Valerian Pidmogilny, which we</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.239" end="00:00:39.120" style="s2">will read closely and discuss  and Bohdana and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.000" end="00:00:41.579" style="s2">have completely different views</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.120" end="00:00:44.160" style="s2">on this text and completely different approaches to</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.579" end="00:00:47.460" style="s2">reading. I think that it is also worth saying about this.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.160" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:52.860" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:00:52.860" end="00:00:58.739" style="s2">now I think about the fact that this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:01:01.440" style="s2">already the 18th episode And it is certainly impressive,</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.739" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">especially now during the war, I realized</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:06.720" style="s2">that it is very important to have projects that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:08.220" style="s2">show you a certain endurance, it does not</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.720" end="00:01:09.780" style="s2">necessarily have to be a podcast, it</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.220" end="00:01:12.900" style="s2">can be some very private things,</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.780" end="00:01:15.720" style="s2">personal practices, but  which allow us</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.900" end="00:01:19.140" style="s2">not to feel like such dense flies</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.720" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">in Amber and to understand how time moves</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.140" end="00:01:23.820" style="s2">because maybe someday you and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:25.740" style="s2">will return to this podcast in</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.820" end="00:01:28.500" style="s2">order to remember what  and we were what we were.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.740" end="00:01:30.420" style="s2">Our intonations, for sure they</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.500" end="00:01:32.780" style="s2">change, for sure they will be different</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.420" end="00:01:35.180" style="s2">later, and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.780" end="00:01:37.619" style="s2">you know it, just like</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.180" end="00:01:40.259" style="s2">rereading, here you and I are</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.619" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">actually reading these classical texts of Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.259" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">literature, and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.840" end="00:01:48.360" style="s2">every time they seem to be the same, but in</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:51.380" style="s2">some way different, because they resonate or not</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.360" end="00:01:54.259" style="s2">resonate to other</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.380" end="00:01:58.200" style="s2">parts of our soul, other</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.259" end="00:01:59.600" style="s2">areas in our brain, and this is also terribly</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.200" end="00:02:02.360" style="s2">interesting because it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.600" end="00:02:05.640" style="s2">very important that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.360" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">you and the text meet. This is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.640" end="00:02:11.099" style="s2">rendezvous, and it may not</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:13.260" style="s2">happen even if the book is very cool.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.099" end="00:02:15.480" style="s2">And I think this is generally very important</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.260" end="00:02:18.420" style="s2">in  in the practice of reading, that is, it often happens that</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.480" end="00:02:21.000" style="s2">there is a cool classic book that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.420" end="00:02:23.459" style="s2">admires. And you pick it up and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.000" end="00:02:26.459" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work for you, maybe you just need a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.459" end="00:02:30.660" style="s2">little time. Probably for me this time,</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.459" end="00:02:33.660" style="s2">because of course there is reading for pleasure, there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.660" end="00:02:36.180" style="s2">reading for work, and for work I</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.660" end="00:02:39.959" style="s2">had to  I would like to read the city and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.180" end="00:02:43.739" style="s2">form my opinion, but my inner</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.959" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">world opposes the novel the city at this</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.739" end="00:02:51.780" style="s2">moment because I cannot help myself</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:54.739" style="s2">I can&#39;t experience this city for myself</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.780" end="00:02:56.599" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.739" end="00:03:00.180" style="s2">pre-war Kyiv seems</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.599" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">irrelevant to me. And after the war I didn&#39;t live in Kyiv</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.180" end="00:03:05.700" style="s2">long enough to rediscover this city for myself,</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.400" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">because I chose a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.700" end="00:03:10.220" style="s2">course for life in a country estate</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:14.120" style="s2">for myself this summer.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.220" end="00:03:18.239" style="s2">I don&#39;t need  in order to win something</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.120" end="00:03:20.819" style="s2">or discover something with a word. Stepan Radchenko is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.239" end="00:03:23.580" style="s2">very distant and not very</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.819" end="00:03:27.319" style="s2">clear hero for me at this particular moment. Also</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.580" end="00:03:30.540" style="s2">, the events of the city take place in</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.319" end="00:03:32.340" style="s2">autumn, autumn in particular.</p>

<p begin="00:03:35.640" end="00:03:40.379" style="s2">And you will answer them, I</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:42.540" style="s2">decided that such</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.379" end="00:03:46.140" style="s2">rules of the game should be established and you have no chance to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.540" end="00:03:48.900" style="s2">disagree, this is just like a public</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.140" end="00:03:51.439" style="s2">interview for which I did not prepare, it</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.900" end="00:03:55.500" style="s2">will be a public</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.439" end="00:03:57.720" style="s2">interview, but in a completely private</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.500" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">atmosphere of a cozy audio lounge, as</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.720" end="00:04:02.340" style="s2">it happens  always I&#39;m very sorry</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:04.760" style="s2">that we have an appointment at 11 and I can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:18.660" style="s2">Well, I have a piece of lime hanging there. It</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.299" end="00:04:21.600" style="s2">adds to the flair, let&#39;s go, and I have a</p>

<p begin="00:04:21.600" end="00:04:27.020" style="s2">also adds to the other flair, coziness, coziness</p>

<p begin="00:08:15.560" end="00:08:21.240" style="s2">unequivocally, French literature is important for Podmohylyny,</p>

<p begin="00:08:37.740" end="00:08:44.519" style="s2">book was published when he was 19 years old and he</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.919" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">called it works Volume 1, that is, it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.519" end="00:08:50.580" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">complete collection of future classics. I</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.580" end="00:08:54.839" style="s2">think that this is actually a characteristic characteristic of</p>

<p begin="00:11:17.100" end="00:11:22.860" style="s2">who is being tried very hard to break, and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.820" end="00:11:25.620" style="s2">it is terribly bitter. I had such</p>

<p begin="00:12:43.100" end="00:12:50.639" style="s2">when we look at the texts of other authors</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.380" end="00:12:53.459" style="s2">of the same years, they are some novels by Hemingway</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.639" end="00:12:54.680" style="s2">or Fitzgerald, which simply become</p>

<p begin="00:13:02.820" end="00:13:08.220" style="s2">trip to Spain and there In particular I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.279" end="00:13:11.639" style="s2">in the city of San Sebastián Really I couldn&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.220" end="00:13:14.459" style="s2">but think about Hemingway&#39;s fiesta about this</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.639" end="00:13:17.700" style="s2">simply the most important novel of the lost</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.459" end="00:13:19.760" style="s2">generation about this character who</p>

<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:26.399" style="s2">very little to say to himself about  love</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.639" end="00:13:29.220" style="s2">about her possibilities and about her place in</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.399" end="00:13:31.579" style="s2">this world. Although no matter how hard she tries,</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.220" end="00:13:34.740" style="s2">even Pidmohylny has such a certain feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.579" end="00:13:38.040" style="s2">detachment. That is, it is very short and the time, the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.740" end="00:13:39.380" style="s2">texts are actually very different. But if</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.040" end="00:13:42.060" style="s2">Pidmohylny</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.380" end="00:13:44.100" style="s2">sounded like he could have sounded</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.060" end="00:13:46.680" style="s2">if Ukraine was free and independent</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.100" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">state, it is quite possible that you and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.680" end="00:13:51.360" style="s2">could buy it  somewhere in the bookstore,</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:54.480" style="s2">Shakespeare and Company, a book that</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.360" end="00:13:56.760" style="s2">interweaves Hemingway’s novel with Pidmogilny’s</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.480" end="00:13:58.800" style="s2">novel, but it is impossible to do this</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.760" end="00:14:02.220" style="s2">because Hemingway becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.800" end="00:14:05.160" style="s2">international legend, and unfortunately, unfortunately,</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.220" end="00:14:07.680" style="s2">he does not even become a</p>

<p begin="00:14:12.540" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">to our audio shelf, then we would start</p>

<p begin="00:14:24.320" end="00:14:30.600" style="s2">translations. We would get his novels,</p>

<p begin="00:14:30.600" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">table there would be a lot of different</p>

<p begin="00:24:02.220" end="00:24:08.700" style="s2">is not a bad memory at all, it is an unwillingness to</p>

<p begin="00:24:08.700" end="00:24:12.720" style="s2">in general, it was very interesting for me to</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.559" end="00:24:15.179" style="s2">reread the city, it was from  point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.720" end="00:24:18.539" style="s2">canonization because there were not so</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.179" end="00:24:20.940" style="s2">many stages in the history of Ukrainian</p>

<p begin="00:24:20.940" end="00:24:24.840" style="s2">think about this canonization in principle</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:28.380" style="s2">and not just try to collect</p>

<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:39.659" style="s2">say a few words about the plot, it is important</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:42.600" style="s2">for our listeners, just to remind</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.659" end="00:24:43.520" style="s2">them of the plot, there is a young guy, Stepan</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.600" end="00:24:47.520" style="s2">Radchenko,</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.520" end="00:24:49.200" style="s2">he comes from the village, but as</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.520" end="00:24:52.460" style="s2">Solomiya Pavlychko rightly tells us, this is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.200" end="00:24:54.659" style="s2">just a Selyuk, not an Odessan, and this is a Selyuk with a</p>

<p begin="00:24:54.659" end="00:24:59.400" style="s2">background  because he managed to fight for everyone,</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.640" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">we understand that this is a person who</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.400" end="00:25:04.740" style="s2">chose different flags for us  clamored to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.640" end="00:25:07.320" style="s2">in different camps and actually did not stick</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.740" end="00:25:10.380" style="s2">to any of them, that is, wherever the wind blows,</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.320" end="00:25:12.500" style="s2">he ended up there and he goes to the city. Why does</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.380" end="00:25:14.900" style="s2">he go to the city, because he is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.500" end="00:25:17.659" style="s2">most talented in his village, he</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.900" end="00:25:20.700" style="s2">shows the most initiative,</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.659" end="00:25:22.980" style="s2">organizational skills, and so on. He</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.700" end="00:25:25.740" style="s2">has to study,</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.980" end="00:25:27.659" style="s2">but  he comes to the city and what he</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.740" end="00:25:30.140" style="s2">sees, well, he sees more</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.659" end="00:25:33.059" style="s2">alternatives, more opportunities,</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.140" end="00:25:36.539" style="s2">he sees people who are dressed differently,</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.059" end="00:25:39.960" style="s2">he sees that there are simply more professions, he was</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.539" end="00:25:41.700" style="s2">able to fill his life more, and</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.960" end="00:25:43.799" style="s2">this is where his great Odyssey begins, a</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.700" end="00:25:45.919" style="s2">great journey, in fact, to himself</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.799" end="00:25:48.299" style="s2">because Roman misto</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.919" end="00:25:51.539" style="s2">tells us about a rather small part of</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.299" end="00:25:53.700" style="s2">time from the life of a young guy</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.539" end="00:25:55.980" style="s2">who is trying to find out who he is</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.700" end="00:25:58.740" style="s2">in general. Against this background, he</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.980" end="00:26:01.620" style="s2">meets different men who</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.740" end="00:26:04.260" style="s2">occupy different positions in the life of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.620" end="00:26:06.960" style="s2">city, and we meet, let&#39;s say, such</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.260" end="00:26:08.700" style="s2">different role models, we also meet</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.960" end="00:26:12.299" style="s2">several  women and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.700" end="00:26:16.380" style="s2">very different romances take place with them within these Romances</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.299" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">Step himself  An Radchenko is also very different and, in</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.380" end="00:26:20.720" style="s2">parallel, Stepan Radchenko is finally trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:23.159" style="s2">become a writer</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:25.799" style="s2">about this novel. It is important for me to</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.159" end="00:26:27.539" style="s2">say what I mean about the plot. What is</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.799" end="00:26:29.100" style="s2">actually the evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.539" end="00:26:31.740" style="s2">Pidmohylnyi conceived it as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.100" end="00:26:34.440" style="s2">screenplay for a movie and that is why</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.740" end="00:26:36.179" style="s2">there is such a fast plot. There is a very</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.440" end="00:26:39.360" style="s2">many such sharp theatrical</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.179" end="00:26:41.940" style="s2">turns because it adds suspense to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.360" end="00:26:44.820" style="s2">film, in the end we still</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.940" end="00:26:46.919" style="s2">have a novel and it is probably a sin to regret it</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.820" end="00:26:50.039" style="s2">because it is not known what the fate of the film would be,</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.919" end="00:26:52.320" style="s2">instead this novel became</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.039" end="00:26:55.260" style="s2">truly key for the history of Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.320" end="00:26:58.559" style="s2">literature and returning to the topic of the city</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.260" end="00:27:01.860" style="s2">what  there is a city in this novel, I tend</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.559" end="00:27:05.520" style="s2">to think that the city is just one of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.860" end="00:27:08.400" style="s2">possible backgrounds, at the same time the city is a sieve</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.520" end="00:27:12.500" style="s2">that passes the main character through it</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.400" end="00:27:14.900" style="s2">and tries to</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.500" end="00:27:18.299" style="s2">offer him to</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.900" end="00:27:21.980" style="s2">maneuver himself or surrender to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.299" end="00:27:24.419" style="s2">elements, and here each of us at different</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.980" end="00:27:27.720" style="s2">stages of our lives can consider</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.419" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">whether  is he more of a fatalist or does he believe in</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.720" end="00:27:31.940" style="s2">his own will I think Stepan Radchenko k</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:35.399" style="s2">if you ask him, he</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.940" end="00:27:37.140" style="s2">probably wouldn&#39;t say himself, is he a fatalist or does</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.399" end="00:27:39.059" style="s2">he believe in his will, because on the one</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.140" end="00:27:42.059" style="s2">hand he is so self-confident and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.059" end="00:27:44.039" style="s2">on, on the other hand, we constantly see how</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.059" end="00:27:47.820" style="s2">he is affected by the choices of others and the decisions of</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.039" end="00:27:51.299" style="s2">others and how</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.820" end="00:27:53.640" style="s2">his mood simply changes dramatically  in fact, Stepan Radchenko is</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.299" end="00:27:56.220" style="s2">somewhat exaggerated in some ways. But perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.640" end="00:27:57.659" style="s2">we can also find the answer in Pidmogilny himself,</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.220" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">who says that he</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.659" end="00:28:05.159" style="s2">conceived this whole story as a comedy</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.520" end="00:28:07.620" style="s2">. In fact, the fact that the city is not an</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.159" end="00:28:10.500" style="s2">obsessive character of this work for me is important to me.</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.620" end="00:28:13.980" style="s2">That is, it is not primarily a novel</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.500" end="00:28:16.320" style="s2">about the city  The novel is communist Yes, but</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.980" end="00:28:18.360" style="s2">it is not intended to describe the Kyiv of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.320" end="00:28:21.740" style="s2">time, it is intended to explore the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.360" end="00:28:25.260" style="s2">modern Undertaker hero of that time,</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.740" end="00:28:27.899" style="s2">who may not have clear views, who is</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.260" end="00:28:32.940" style="s2">looking for himself, who wants happiness, wants joy,</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.899" end="00:28:34.799" style="s2">and it is simply good literature But at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.940" end="00:28:37.080" style="s2">expense of the fact that it is good literature  we</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.799" end="00:28:38.580" style="s2">get these additional benefits as it</p>

<p begin="00:28:53.279" end="00:28:57.299" style="s2">n&#39;t call them bad guys, and what</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.440" end="00:28:59.220" style="s2">they are like from the point of view of literature, because I</p>

<p begin="00:30:58.140" end="00:31:07.140" style="s2">important for me that it is already the middle of the novel.</p>

<p begin="00:32:33.059" end="00:32:39.320" style="s2">spit, looking at the hundreds of faces that</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.519" end="00:32:42.179" style="s2">floated past the bars, taking</p>

<p begin="00:32:48.659" end="00:32:54.980" style="s2">to the maid. The passing</p>

<p begin="00:32:54.980" end="00:33:01.559" style="s2">convinced him the most because he</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.899" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">had never heard of such concerts, and after getting on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.559" end="00:33:05.640" style="s2">bus, even though it was only two blocks to go,</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.080" end="00:33:09.720" style="s2">he reached Volodymyrska</p>

<p begin="00:33:19.980" end="00:33:26.220" style="s2">, the crowd had a strange effect on him. He</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.399" end="00:33:28.860" style="s2">continued to watch this crowd, he went to</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.220" end="00:33:33.260" style="s2">this concert and did not listen very carefully to him,</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.860" end="00:33:36.720" style="s2">but during the intermission he realized that</p>

<p begin="00:33:45.960" end="00:33:52.200" style="s2">shared by a very sick person, making</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:55.140" style="s2">him a foreign body that accidentally</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.200" end="00:33:58.500" style="s2">got inside a well-functioning</p>

<p begin="00:34:10.919" end="00:34:16.139" style="s2">months of human exploits were now</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.320" end="00:34:19.260" style="s2">turning into his shame,</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.139" end="00:34:21.720" style="s2">at the end of this episode, he will</p>

<p begin="00:34:25.679" end="00:34:32.820" style="s2">fragment, I understand for myself that this is a Kyiv text,</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.579" end="00:34:35.099" style="s2">in particular, despite what you said a few</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.820" end="00:34:39.440" style="s2">minutes ago  that he does not necessarily have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.099" end="00:34:41.639" style="s2">be from Kyiv, but here it is. The city of</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.440" end="00:34:44.639" style="s2">Pidmogilny belonged to several cities</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.639" end="00:34:47.399" style="s2">at the same time. He was from the Dnipro and about the Dnipro. A</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.639" end="00:34:49.740" style="s2">small drama about his texts. He was a</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.399" end="00:34:52.139" style="s2">Kharkiv author. He was from Kyiv.</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.740" end="00:34:55.520" style="s2">He belonged to the Kyiv organization of the branch,</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.139" end="00:34:58.040" style="s2">and this text has so many</p>

<p begin="00:34:58.040" end="00:35:03.900" style="s2">alleys, places, what can we say</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.560" end="00:35:07.680" style="s2">such a pattern of reproaches  istati</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.900" end="00:35:08.960" style="s2">We are walking through the city of Pidmogilny and this</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.680" end="00:35:11.520" style="s2">will really be a template that we will</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.960" end="00:35:14.099" style="s2">work on because there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.520" end="00:35:17.099" style="s2">places that Stepan Radchenko used</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.099" end="00:35:20.520" style="s2">to go and today we walk in these places and this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.099" end="00:35:23.400" style="s2">actually the Kyiv text and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.520" end="00:35:26.339" style="s2">belonging of the marking of specific</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.400" end="00:35:29.280" style="s2">streets of specific moods of a specific</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.339" end="00:35:33.720" style="s2">environment that, for example, came to the theater</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:35.880" style="s2">and  to which he does not quite belong, they</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.720" end="00:35:40.380" style="s2">also read magazines, they are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.880" end="00:35:42.839" style="s2">art, but they are different from him, and he has</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.380" end="00:35:45.119" style="s2">not done anything during this year, during his stay</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.839" end="00:35:47.940" style="s2">in this place, to get closer to them.</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.119" end="00:35:50.880" style="s2">Do you agree with Bohdana</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.940" end="00:35:53.880" style="s2">that this is a text about Kyiv, a novel about Kyiv  if</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.880" end="00:35:56.280" style="s2">I didn&#39;t agree, I&#39;d be an idiot. Of course</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.880" end="00:36:00.980" style="s2">I agree, and what&#39;s more, I would very much like</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.280" end="00:36:03.839" style="s2">our Kyiv space to be marked with a</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.980" end="00:36:06.420" style="s2">gravestone and signs from the Graveyard,</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.839" end="00:36:09.599" style="s2">or for example, I sometimes go to a</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.420" end="00:36:13.560" style="s2">coffee shop in Na Valakh precisely because it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.599" end="00:36:17.160" style="s2">approximately where I had  I wish I could live with my</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.560" end="00:36:19.680" style="s2">second love, the hero of Undertaker, and</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.160" end="00:36:21.380" style="s2">that I wouldn&#39;t be there. It&#39;s nice to think about it,</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.680" end="00:36:25.200" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:36:21.380" end="00:36:27.900" style="s2">I&#39;m clinging to something  you know, that is, when</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.200" end="00:36:30.560" style="s2">we talk about this theater audience, we</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.900" end="00:36:32.660" style="s2">also understand that if the reader were to read this to</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.560" end="00:36:36.540" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:36:32.660" end="00:36:38.099" style="s2">Paris, where Pidmohylnyi also visited, or to</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.540" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">any other city, he would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.099" end="00:36:44.220" style="s2">understand this. That is, we, through Stepan</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:46.440" style="s2">Radchenko, have the opportunity to look at the city with the eyes of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.220" end="00:36:49.500" style="s2">neophyte.</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.440" end="00:36:52.320" style="s2">social institutions, how does the theater work,</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.500" end="00:36:56.599" style="s2">how does the institute work, how does the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.320" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">street work, how does the expensive clothing store work,</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.599" end="00:37:03.780" style="s2">we look at some such, how would it be better to</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:06.599" style="s2">say, both at the top and at the bottom,</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.780" end="00:37:10.920" style="s2">and together with Radchenko we try on some</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.599" end="00:37:12.660" style="s2">emotions for ourselves because you know, I really</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.920" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">like this  the fragment that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.660" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">read is also like this, even this is even</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.839" end="00:37:22.680" style="s2">neuroticism, it is somehow already sarcasm in</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:27.119" style="s2">Pidmogilny, because Radchenko, who has been</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.680" end="00:37:30.780" style="s2">living in Kyiv for a year, and in fact, he has a</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.119" end="00:37:34.140" style="s2">small but certain success, he begins to</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.780" end="00:37:37.140" style="s2">flirt, that is, he is like that, saying Oh no, I am</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.140" end="00:37:42.740" style="s2">so separate and all that  And we understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.140" end="00:37:46.859" style="s2">that this is a human trait, this is a certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.740" end="00:37:49.680" style="s2">ability to exaggerate. This is the desire</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.859" end="00:37:51.359" style="s2">to drive oneself into a certain critical</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.680" end="00:37:54.240" style="s2">state.  that this critical state then</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.359" end="00:37:57.060" style="s2">provokes a certain creativity, we see that</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.240" end="00:37:59.160" style="s2">Stepan Radchenko is nevertheless an artist, although</p>

<p begin="00:37:59.160" end="00:38:03.720" style="s2">in the school where he was supposed to study, he</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.220" end="00:38:05.700" style="s2">was supposed to be preparing himself to</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.720" end="00:38:07.920" style="s2">return to his native village and improve</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.700" end="00:38:10.560" style="s2">his life and  to make their collective</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.920" end="00:38:13.079" style="s2">farms the best collective farms in the entire Soviet</p>

<p begin="00:38:13.079" end="00:38:17.820" style="s2">limited. And it is very practically</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.619" end="00:38:21.180" style="s2">utilitarian, that is, to go study and</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.820" end="00:38:23.339" style="s2">return himself. Pidmogilny, who</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.180" end="00:38:25.560" style="s2">never obtained a certain higher education, was</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.339" end="00:38:28.140" style="s2">also preparing himself for another. He was supposed to become a</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.560" end="00:38:30.300" style="s2">polytechnic. Instead, he is studying French on his own</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.140" end="00:38:32.700" style="s2">language to a level that</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.300" end="00:38:36.960" style="s2">allows him to read and translate, he</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.700" end="00:38:36.960" style="s2">begins to write very early. He</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.320" end="00:38:43.680" style="s2">is also such a special type. But we</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.560" end="00:38:46.079" style="s2">can all recognize among Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.680" end="00:38:48.180" style="s2">contemporary artists similar people who supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.079" end="00:38:51.060" style="s2">come from the outside, but it is this arrival</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.180" end="00:38:54.599" style="s2">from the outside that gives them a rather unique</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.060" end="00:38:56.599" style="s2">outsider&#39;s optics or despite the ironic Stepan</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.599" end="00:38:59.339" style="s2">Radchenko  towards the end - It&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.599" end="00:39:02.520" style="s2">mockery of him  you, that is, when he</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.339" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">starts this tour of his loved ones. It</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.520" end="00:39:06.839" style="s2">seems to me that he is already simply</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.320" end="00:39:09.240" style="s2">carrying the Undertaker, he cannot help himself. It is very</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.839" end="00:39:11.760" style="s2">funny to him because Stepan Radchenko</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.240" end="00:39:14.119" style="s2">convinces himself at first, he so involuntarily</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.760" end="00:39:17.280" style="s2">says oh, we have to find him there, see,</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.119" end="00:39:19.320" style="s2">then he starts looking for her, although</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.280" end="00:39:21.839" style="s2">he has just  hesitated Does he need this, he is</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.320" end="00:39:24.260" style="s2">already locked in here, he is already looking for her and he is like</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.839" end="00:39:27.300" style="s2">Oh God, she will meet me How will it be?</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.260" end="00:39:29.640" style="s2">Then he meets this woman and</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.300" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">it turns out that she is not his, she</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.640" end="00:39:35.640" style="s2">was not waiting for him and so on. Well, what about Stepana</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:38.280" style="s2">Radchenko?  so youthful and how it</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.640" end="00:39:40.579" style="s2">hurts him, this incredible amplitude of</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.280" end="00:39:43.560" style="s2">emotions is very cool She manages to be a</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.579" end="00:39:46.020" style="s2">gravedigger and Well, listen to her, we also</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.560" end="00:39:48.599" style="s2">see what is given on our streets and not</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.020" end="00:39:50.359" style="s2">only in people of Stepan Radchenko&#39;s age.</p>

<p begin="00:39:56.940" end="00:40:01.460" style="s2">also interesting for me to think about</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.680" end="00:40:04.339" style="s2">it here. Well, in the case of Radchenko, it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.460" end="00:40:07.380" style="s2">finding yourself, it&#39;s returning to yourself,</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.339" end="00:40:09.140" style="s2">it&#39;s discovering yourself  that is, I don&#39;t fully</p>

<p begin="00:40:29.780" end="00:40:35.780" style="s2">about this difference of the city that arises in</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.359" end="00:40:38.520" style="s2">different societies, because for the</p>

<p begin="00:40:44.760" end="00:40:51.260" style="s2">through the intellect, often through history, and for</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.980" end="00:40:54.180" style="s2">Pidmogilny, the City, whether it is Dnipro,</p>

<p begin="00:41:12.540" end="00:41:17.599" style="s2">you know, I also think about  the fact that Solomiya</p>

<p begin="00:41:17.599" end="00:41:23.480" style="s2">Domontovych and Pidmohylny and she</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.700" end="00:41:26.700" style="s2">explains why she does this  despite</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.480" end="00:41:29.760" style="s2">very, very different experiences. Both</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.700" end="00:41:31.920" style="s2">Domontovych and Pidmohylnyi give this fuller</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.760" end="00:41:34.079" style="s2">picture of the new city. Here it is important to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.920" end="00:41:35.579" style="s2">that they are not describing it for the first time, but they</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.079" end="00:41:37.140" style="s2">are describing it in this period.</p>

<p begin="00:42:01.980" end="00:42:06.680" style="s2">I think of Pidmohylyny as such,</p>

<p begin="00:42:11.640" end="00:42:14.400" style="s2">many  things, he was not afraid to be</p>

<p begin="00:42:14.400" end="00:42:20.119" style="s2">professional and he showed many a</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.540" end="00:42:23.520" style="s2">rather unexpected path to</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.119" end="00:42:27.359" style="s2">professionalism, which lies through a certain</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.520" end="00:42:29.819" style="s2">sensuality, through a passionate interest, this</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.359" end="00:42:32.819" style="s2">path is not through the university, and we understand</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.819" end="00:42:34.500" style="s2">that these approaches can be combined, they</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.819" end="00:42:37.200" style="s2">can exist separately and</p>

<p begin="00:42:40.500" end="00:42:46.140" style="s2">shows that it can work</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.619" end="00:42:47.540" style="s2">very powerfully, that is, you don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:43:13.020" end="00:43:19.680" style="s2">arrives at his higher educational institution</p>

<p begin="00:43:30.119" end="00:43:35.280" style="s2">why shake hands with him, drink</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.579" end="00:43:37.859" style="s2">there, then go for a beer and the same story</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.280" end="00:43:40.760" style="s2">wherever he ends up, it&#39;s actually and</p>

<p begin="00:45:04.560" end="00:45:11.220" style="s2">opportunity has come. I am reading it from the magazine Universe for</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.380" end="00:47:24.720" style="s2">be an alphonse, and at the same time he thinks about</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.260" end="00:47:28.200" style="s2">how lucky women are, they say, a woman has</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.720" end="00:47:30.180" style="s2">a husband, that&#39;s his problem, so that</p>

<p begin="00:47:43.920" end="00:47:48.900" style="s2">when I look at the cover of the book</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.619" end="00:47:52.440" style="s2">association&#39;s edition, I realize that it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.900" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">laconic, I want to pick it up, but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.440" end="00:47:57.480" style="s2">also ironic because  that the novel that</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:47:59.579" style="s2">tells us so much about Kyiv and gives us</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.480" end="00:48:03.660" style="s2">information about this Kyiv actually</p>

<p begin="00:48:05.819" end="00:48:11.400" style="s2">that is, the ability of a person to determine what</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.000" end="00:48:14.819" style="s2">he wants and what he does not want, how he</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.400" end="00:48:17.579" style="s2">wants, who he loves, what he is</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.819" end="00:48:21.920" style="s2">interested in, who he sees himself in this</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.579" end="00:48:24.720" style="s2">world, and just the background of the city here really becomes</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.920" end="00:48:26.460" style="s2">non-trivial new, but I thought  By the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.720" end="00:48:28.440" style="s2">way, today we will also talk about</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.460" end="00:48:31.079" style="s2">Ukrainization, because Stepan Radchenko is</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.440" end="00:48:33.420" style="s2">working on courses on Ukrainization. But</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.079" end="00:48:34.440" style="s2">it is clear that for me it is not at all like</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.420" end="00:48:37.200" style="s2">Germany.</p>

<p begin="00:48:43.940" end="00:48:49.380" style="s2">this is, let&#39;s say, a fruit for</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.880" end="00:48:51.839" style="s2">literary critics and for readers who</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.380" end="00:48:54.240" style="s2">read on Skyphone, and not necessarily a</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.839" end="00:48:56.240" style="s2">context in which to dive, because</p>

<p begin="00:48:56.240" end="00:49:01.559" style="s2">context of this private journey of the</p>

<p begin="00:49:04.079" end="00:49:09.240" style="s2">such a journey and does the city help  in</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.079" end="00:49:11.940" style="s2">which there are far more irritants</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.240" end="00:49:15.180" style="s2">than in the village and it would seem that she has you</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.940" end="00:49:17.940" style="s2">over  to go motivate to reveal yourself or</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.180" end="00:49:20.339" style="s2">vice versa it prevents you And maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.940" end="00:49:22.920" style="s2">could do it somewhere else, for example at</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.339" end="00:49:25.920" style="s2">home and this is a terribly valuable city</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.920" end="00:49:28.740" style="s2">because it is not intrusive it is not</p>
