<p begin="00:03:49.260" end="00:03:54.480" style="s2">Ukrainian literature there is a theme of homelessness</p>

<p begin="00:04:01.739" end="00:04:07.680" style="s2">building  his from scratch, for example, Taras</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.680" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">Shevchenko dreamed of his home and he wrote</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.680" end="00:04:15.060" style="s2">about the fact that home is a certain R  ay, this is a certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.280" end="00:04:18.120" style="s2">model at the end of life already in the 1860s,</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.060" end="00:04:21.600" style="s2">for example, he had a beloved liquor store,</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.120" end="00:04:25.320" style="s2">he dedicated various texts to her, there is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.600" end="00:04:28.320" style="s2">text and there he says I will build a house and a room</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.320" end="00:04:30.840" style="s2">and a garden, I will plant raisin trees. That is, you need to</p>

<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:41.759" style="s2">and the house of Taras Shevchenko is such a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:43.740" style="s2">starting point. In order to talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.759" end="00:04:47.160" style="s2">about home in Ukrainian literature in general,</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.740" end="00:04:48.419" style="s2">because Ukrainian writers found houses, they</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.160" end="00:04:51.780" style="s2">lost them, so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.419" end="00:04:54.419" style="s2">hero of the demotonovych in the novel of landlessness</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.780" end="00:04:57.479" style="s2">who returns to his hometown  in his native</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.419" end="00:05:00.840" style="s2">Katerynoslav Dnipropetrovsk, he thinks about</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.479" end="00:05:03.540" style="s2">what his home is like, because modern people have</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.840" end="00:05:07.500" style="s2">generally developed the habit of not having their own</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.540" end="00:05:10.160" style="s2">corner, not having something to which they can</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.500" end="00:05:13.020" style="s2">tie themselves, not having their own soil,</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.160" end="00:05:15.660" style="s2">it&#39;s romantic, it&#39;s as if something was</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.020" end="00:05:17.880" style="s2">quite fashionable and trendy, it seemed that</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.660" end="00:05:20.100" style="s2">if you  you can put everything in one</p>

<p begin="00:05:25.080" end="00:05:30.060" style="s2">simple, so not everything is so simple, because Natalya Humenyuk,</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.960" end="00:05:32.940" style="s2">for example, writes about the lost home today</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.060" end="00:05:35.039" style="s2">in the collection of reports &quot;The</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.940" end="00:05:37.800" style="s2">Lost Island&quot; when she writes about the Crimea,</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.039" end="00:05:41.479" style="s2">and those Crimean Tatars who, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.800" end="00:05:44.759" style="s2">were forced to leave their home, also write about the home</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.479" end="00:05:49.139" style="s2">, and authors who consider the topic in the</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.900" end="00:07:47.639" style="s2">homelessness in Serhiy Zhadana&#39;s boarding school</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.759" end="00:07:49.979" style="s2">this is our second episode. It was only the beginning,</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.460" end="00:08:09.180" style="s2">odyssey I really liked the selection of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.979" end="00:08:10.460" style="s2">texts that you suggested  But when I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.180" end="00:08:13.919" style="s2">listening to Oleg,</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.460" end="00:08:15.720" style="s2">I immediately remembered that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.919" end="00:08:19.639" style="s2">recently had an interview with Oksana</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.720" end="00:08:22.919" style="s2">Zabuzhko on Ukrainians, which I was lucky enough to do, and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.639" end="00:08:25.259" style="s2">my original idea was to</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.919" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">ask Oksana Zabuzhko why she</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.259" end="00:08:32.580" style="s2">wrote her two novels and what she</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:35.039" style="s2">wanted to achieve with them, and when we  when they came</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.580" end="00:08:37.640" style="s2">to the topic of the Museum of Abandoned Secrets,</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:41.039" style="s2">Oksana Zabuzhko immediately said that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.640" end="00:08:42.779" style="s2">she would like to write a novel, The House, because</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.039" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">she felt that we lack such a novel.</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.779" end="00:08:48.180" style="s2">It will be big, it will have</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">many rooms, a certain number of floors, there</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.180" end="00:08:54.720" style="s2">will be balconies, amphitheaters, and so on.</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:57.420" style="s2">She wanted it to be like this  You could</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.720" end="00:09:00.660" style="s2">dive into the novel, hide, interact with</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.420" end="00:09:03.240" style="s2">it as we can with the house, because again, the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.660" end="00:09:05.519" style="s2">house is different spaces. There will be a sub  and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.240" end="00:09:08.940" style="s2">there will be an attic, there will be your children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.519" end="00:09:11.640" style="s2">room and a locker in which you hid some</p>

<p begin="00:13:10.200" end="00:13:15.600" style="s2">we need to focus on each region and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.839" end="00:13:18.300" style="s2">talk about what literature described</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.600" end="00:13:20.339" style="s2">this region, which authors were local and</p>

<p begin="00:27:33.900" end="00:27:40.700" style="s2">thought about such a thing that</p>

<p begin="00:27:59.480" end="00:28:04.039" style="s2">genre or style, then in my opinion we are</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.940" end="00:28:07.760" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.039" end="00:28:10.440" style="s2">craft, which can also be of high quality, but</p>

<p begin="00:35:02.580" end="00:35:07.859" style="s2">, some old interpretations are accepted that have</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.160" end="00:35:10.859" style="s2">barely changed over the past 30</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.859" end="00:35:14.640" style="s2">no one is engaged in actual reading,</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:16.980" style="s2">reading is a creative process, we all</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.640" end="00:35:20.099" style="s2">remember that there are three factors of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.980" end="00:35:23.040" style="s2">literary process: the author, the texts, the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.099" end="00:35:25.579" style="s2">readers and  they are equivalent when we</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.040" end="00:35:28.140" style="s2">exclude the reader from this process  so there</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.579" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">is nothing left, literature</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.140" end="00:35:33.660" style="s2">as such is actually absent, so I would</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:37.079" style="s2">be happy if the texts</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.660" end="00:35:39.660" style="s2">were really read and discussed in schools, and on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.079" end="00:35:42.020" style="s2">other hand, well, we actually have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.660" end="00:35:45.000" style="s2">problems with</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.000" end="00:35:48.980" style="s2">I think to myself that</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.000" end="00:35:51.240" style="s2">while, for example, the</p>

<p begin="00:35:51.240" end="00:35:57.020" style="s2">Politicians are incredibly worried about the fate of</p>

<p begin="00:35:59.820" end="00:36:05.460" style="s2">Pidmogilny or Kyivdomontovych, then it</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.180" end="00:36:07.619" style="s2">will not be easy for us either, although</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.460" end="00:36:10.560" style="s2">there is no shortage of independent initiatives and we have listed some of them,</p>

<p begin="00:36:10.560" end="00:36:16.260" style="s2">clichéd political will is very important and until the</p>

<p begin="00:36:23.880" end="00:36:28.079" style="s2">it will be very difficult to change anything. But</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.520" end="00:36:30.720" style="s2">fortunately, Germany still has</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.079" end="00:36:33.780" style="s2">some allies in the form of</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.720" end="00:36:36.300" style="s2">some teachers who know how to fall in love with</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.780" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">this literature despite all the challenges of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.300" end="00:36:40.859" style="s2">school curriculum every time there</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:44.060" style="s2">is a conversation about the problems</p>

<p begin="00:47:53.099" end="00:47:59.099" style="s2">was how not to offend the Russians, how not to</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.560" end="00:48:00.980" style="s2">provoke the Russians, how not to make the Russians</p>

<p begin="00:48:13.200" end="00:48:18.440" style="s2">was blown up by the Bolsheviks in the 1930s because they</p>

<p begin="00:48:18.440" end="00:48:25.740" style="s2">history of Kyiv, and I decided to look for</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.280" end="00:48:27.599" style="s2">some materials because I thought, Well, in the 90s, there</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.740" end="00:48:31.380" style="s2">must be certain references on the Internet about</p>

<p begin="00:48:51.420" end="00:48:56.819" style="s2">is not even to ask, but to say that it is</p>
