<p begin="00:04:39.660" end="00:04:43.500" style="s2">language, there is actually some kind of beginning</p>

<p begin="00:05:04.380" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">in fact even before the ancient times, and when we</p>

<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:17.400" style="s2">we are already mentioning folklore.  in the previous</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.120" end="00:05:20.160" style="s2">episodes, we mentioned folk songs and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.400" end="00:05:23.000" style="s2">it is so important to know the folk songs of your</p>

<p begin="00:05:23.000" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">dedicated to one or another topic, and to</p>

<p begin="00:05:31.979" end="00:05:35.699" style="s2">absorbed the history of the people. Because when we</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.960" end="00:05:37.680" style="s2">talk about  the Ukrainian language is the day of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.699" end="00:05:40.400" style="s2">Ukrainian language and writing, when on</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:42.780" style="s2">November 9, the day of the death of</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.120" end="00:05:50.699" style="s2">why Nestor the Chronicler and the Ukrainian language</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:52.940" style="s2">are on the same line because Nestor the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.699" end="00:05:55.560" style="s2">Chronicler is one of the first</p>

<p begin="00:05:58.860" end="00:06:06.539" style="s2">historical realities, but also the history of the</p>

<p begin="00:06:06.539" end="00:06:11.220" style="s2">family, one of the first writers who</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.940" end="00:06:12.780" style="s2">worked with fiction from those</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.220" end="00:06:15.180" style="s2">writers then went to our days and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.780" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">about whom we know from the history of literature.</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.180" end="00:06:22.259" style="s2">I am sure that there were many who</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:25.259" style="s2">sank into oblivion and time forgot about them and our</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.259" end="00:06:29.280" style="s2">Our language begins with these two foundations from a</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.259" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">song from the chronicle and in  the annals have written</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.280" end="00:06:35.880" style="s2">words with which we can even remain silent</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:38.639" style="s2">because if the annals answer about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.880" end="00:06:41.819" style="s2">princes and their princes between individuals about</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.639" end="00:06:44.220" style="s2">their conflicts about their victories and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.819" end="00:06:48.240" style="s2">defeats, then these are also the victories and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.220" end="00:06:51.060" style="s2">defeats of the Ukrainian statesmen not only</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.240" end="00:06:55.160" style="s2">those who were then in the princely times in the 11th-12th</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.060" end="00:06:57.720" style="s2">century  but these are also certain lessons that were later</p>

<p begin="00:07:05.039" end="00:07:08.759" style="s2">like how in this short</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.660" end="00:07:10.860" style="s2">text Holoborodko does what he</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.759" end="00:07:15.240" style="s2">actually does very well in all</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.860" end="00:07:18.240" style="s2">poetry. And it speaks next to something</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.240" end="00:07:21.000" style="s2">global about something very private.</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.240" end="00:07:23.720" style="s2">Because Ukrainian song and especially</p>

<p begin="00:11:48.839" end="00:11:53.180" style="s2">more and more philological over the years</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.700" end="00:11:57.779" style="s2">philological, he writes a lot</p>

<p begin="00:17:30.360" end="00:17:35.160" style="s2">ago and today I can tell you that I,</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:38.880" style="s2">for example, started to think in Ukrainian, it</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.160" end="00:17:41.220" style="s2">works in the end, he continues the language in which I am</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.880" end="00:17:44.340" style="s2">silent, the language of breathing and crying, that is, the language in</p>

<p begin="00:17:54.679" end="00:18:01.620" style="s2">once one of my girlfriends read that</p>

<p begin="00:18:10.200" end="00:18:16.799" style="s2">thinking that I have to find out what language</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.320" end="00:18:19.679" style="s2">I speak in my unconscious and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.799" end="00:18:22.980" style="s2">talks to me  and she realized that</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.679" end="00:18:25.020" style="s2">she is silent in her dreams, she and all the characters</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.980" end="00:18:27.900" style="s2">around are also silent, they understand each</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.020" end="00:18:30.480" style="s2">other at some level of touch of</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.900" end="00:18:32.539" style="s2">glances and simply know what will happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">next, but in us she asked herself this question</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.539" end="00:18:38.280" style="s2">because it was important to her, she expected that</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:41.220" style="s2">somewhere subconsciously he was preparing her for  it</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.280" end="00:18:43.260" style="s2">is somehow a betrayal of the well-known scandalous essay by Taras</p>

<p begin="00:18:46.260" end="00:18:51.299" style="s2">it caused a very ambiguous reaction,</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.600" end="00:18:54.140" style="s2">but this only shows that when we</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.299" end="00:18:56.760" style="s2">talk about language in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.140" end="00:19:00.600" style="s2">our subconscious, the topic is very</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.760" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">dramatic. Language is a means of protection. It</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.600" end="00:19:06.419" style="s2">can be  yes, but also a means of understanding,</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.559" end="00:19:08.419" style="s2">first of all, I think that when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.419" end="00:19:12.860" style="s2">about language today, we</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.419" end="00:19:16.679" style="s2">think about it through selected texts in</p>

<p begin="00:19:16.679" end="00:19:20.100" style="s2">but since we chose</p>

<p begin="00:25:03.380" end="00:25:09.179" style="s2">which work very effectively and sound very fresh</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.140" end="00:25:11.580" style="s2">, because for example, now I want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.179" end="00:25:13.820" style="s2">read a text by Kateryna Kalitko, which</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.580" end="00:25:17.039" style="s2">develops a very</p>

<p begin="00:25:17.039" end="00:25:24.140" style="s2">Lesya Ukrainka proposes, but does it  in</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.679" end="00:25:28.980" style="s2">2021, and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.140" end="00:25:31.080" style="s2">many people are even typing the first words of</p>

<p begin="00:26:59.760" end="00:27:05.880" style="s2">then all at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.919" end="00:27:08.900" style="s2">Who said that we throw at will, we</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.880" end="00:27:08.900" style="s2">armed as much as we could</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.539" end="00:27:14.820" style="s2">Well, in general, there are a lot of contexts that can be</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.299" end="00:27:17.000" style="s2">unrolled from Kateryna Kalitka, both</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.820" end="00:27:19.260" style="s2">from the key translator of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.000" end="00:27:22.620" style="s2">Croatian literature and from the</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.260" end="00:27:25.380" style="s2">Russian-Ukrainian War.</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.620" end="00:27:27.320" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:27:25.380" end="00:27:30.659" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:27:27.320" end="00:27:33.840" style="s2">after all, there is an emphasis on the power of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.659" end="00:27:36.899" style="s2">woman&#39;s voice and the power of women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.840" end="00:27:39.679" style="s2">capabilities. And what was</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.899" end="00:27:42.140" style="s2">very important to me during this reading was that</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.679" end="00:27:45.120" style="s2">Kalitko writes that</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.140" end="00:27:48.020" style="s2">you were not left to your own devices and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.120" end="00:27:52.260" style="s2">actually have a lot in your hands about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.020" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">Ukrainian language and the achievements of this language. This is</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.260" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">also the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:59.279" style="s2">story of what works on  us We do not</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.120" end="00:28:02.240" style="s2">invent something now out of thin air it</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.279" end="00:28:06.080" style="s2">is not  by some tricks, this is the story of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.240" end="00:28:09.020" style="s2">deep tradition of a distant history that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.080" end="00:28:13.679" style="s2">comes to life today, archetypes,</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.020" end="00:28:15.899" style="s2">this is somewhere zaluzhnyy said that when</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.679" end="00:28:18.659" style="s2">he looks at the Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.899" end="00:28:21.000" style="s2">military today, it constantly seems to him that</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.659" end="00:28:22.760" style="s2">some Cossacks, some</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.000" end="00:28:26.240" style="s2">Upis,</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.760" end="00:28:29.240" style="s2">some Sich riflemen are appearing somewhere, and</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.240" end="00:28:34.860" style="s2">this means that simply in</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.240" end="00:28:37.799" style="s2">such times, everything is like that  works in Ukraine and, in</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.860" end="00:28:41.279" style="s2">principle, Kalitko is also very cool, just like</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.799" end="00:28:44.340" style="s2">Zhadan, he plays with this sensuality, where on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.279" end="00:28:47.399" style="s2">one hand there is extreme cruelty, to</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.340" end="00:28:49.320" style="s2">which many will say that it is not good for a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.399" end="00:28:51.200" style="s2">woman to express herself like that,</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.320" end="00:28:53.880" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.200" end="00:28:57.000" style="s2">I am sure that Kalitko is saying exactly</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.880" end="00:29:00.299" style="s2">what she wants to say, it is well thought out  and in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.000" end="00:29:04.440" style="s2">next line, she says to</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.299" end="00:29:07.640" style="s2">her heroine that she said, Stay with your son,</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.440" end="00:29:11.419" style="s2">Stay with your husband, that is, there</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.640" end="00:29:15.240" style="s2">is poetry in this universe, there is space for both the</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.419" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">private and for understanding what you</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.240" end="00:29:20.700" style="s2">can do in a critical situation, and this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:22.260" style="s2">really determined by language if we were to</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.700" end="00:29:25.140" style="s2">discuss with you now  Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.260" end="00:29:27.779" style="s2">literature of the time of independence would therefore be</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.140" end="00:29:30.679" style="s2">divided into certain stages related to</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.779" end="00:29:32.539" style="s2">various literary contests, phenomena,</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.679" end="00:29:35.820" style="s2">generations,</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.539" end="00:29:39.059" style="s2">publishing houses, but without fail We would</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.820" end="00:29:42.899" style="s2">remember that in 2014, when the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.059" end="00:29:45.960" style="s2">war began, a lot has changed</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.899" end="00:29:49.919" style="s2">in Ukrainian literature since then, namely at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.960" end="00:29:52.860" style="s2">themes, because in each poetry collection of each</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.919" end="00:29:56.820" style="s2">author, one way or another, we will find some</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.860" end="00:29:59.220" style="s2">tiny echo of the war in a larger or</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.820" end="00:30:03.480" style="s2">smaller  to the extent and actually of Kateryna Kalitku</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.220" end="00:30:07.080" style="s2">after 2014, the through-and-through and main</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.480" end="00:30:11.279" style="s2">theme of all her texts is war. Although it</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.080" end="00:30:13.380" style="s2">can also be said that there is a history of Vinnytsia and</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.279" end="00:30:16.020" style="s2">Vinnytsia, in particular, because she is a Vinnytsia</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.380" end="00:30:18.419" style="s2">author and this Vinnytsia text is also</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.020" end="00:30:21.500" style="s2">present, and I am waiting for</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.419" end="00:30:24.179" style="s2">tours of Vinnytsia based on Kalitku&#39;s texts to appear  and</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.500" end="00:30:27.539" style="s2">maybe even from the very gate with</p>

<p begin="00:31:12.600" end="00:31:19.980" style="s2">the same thing, about some vision of a bright</p>

<p begin="00:31:19.980" end="00:31:25.679" style="s2">Ukraine wins the war, as soon as our</p>

<p begin="00:36:07.800" end="00:36:12.240" style="s2">from how this language works, how</p>

<p begin="00:40:26.579" end="00:40:31.500" style="s2">see today</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:35.760" style="s2">thanks to the publisher Savchuk, who made a</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.500" end="00:40:35.760" style="s2">wonderful reprint edition, but</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.599" end="00:40:42.480" style="s2">this is something very  unusual So when you try to</p>

<p begin="00:40:59.940" end="00:41:07.680" style="s2">something like Bauhaus. And he  draws the alphabet,</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.460" end="00:41:10.200" style="s2">we are not at all used to concentrating on</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.680" end="00:41:12.780" style="s2">our own, and I think this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.200" end="00:41:15.619" style="s2">we all learn to this day, it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.780" end="00:41:19.740" style="s2">not a matter of being proud, but</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.619" end="00:41:22.079" style="s2">it is how you love yours. You do not say how you treat</p>

<p begin="00:41:45.180" end="00:41:51.720" style="s2">it looks like and the fact that the talented Narbut</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.560" end="00:41:55.319" style="s2">devotes so much of his airtime to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.720" end="00:41:58.079" style="s2">alphabet shows us a simple thing that it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.319" end="00:42:00.000" style="s2">worth it  when we look at</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.079" end="00:42:02.060" style="s2">anything made by Narb for the Ukrainian state,</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.000" end="00:42:05.160" style="s2">I always have this feeling,</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.060" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">apart from the depth. Besides this tangible</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.160" end="00:42:09.480" style="s2">admiration for Narb and Cossack Baroque, I</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.200" end="00:42:12.420" style="s2">always have a thought: it is so</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.480" end="00:42:13.339" style="s2">cool, it is so attractive, it is worth</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.420" end="00:42:17.400" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:42:13.339" end="00:42:19.680" style="s2">paying attention to. Are these illustrations like</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.400" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">that? That is  we have already said repeatedly that</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.680" end="00:42:25.859" style="s2">Narbut worked for zero and they even have</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:28.440" style="s2">joint publishing projects, but this is money</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.859" end="00:42:31.680" style="s2">from the times of the Ukrainian People&#39;s Republic, for example, and it is so beautiful,</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.440" end="00:42:34.079" style="s2">or it is our small coat of arms</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.680" end="00:42:36.380" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.079" end="00:42:39.480" style="s2">100 years ago we really learned this, we</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.380" end="00:42:41.700" style="s2">continue to learn this today, but</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.480" end="00:42:43.619" style="s2">I would be very interested somehow  ask</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.700" end="00:42:45.960" style="s2">Andruhovych how he came up with this text</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.619" end="00:42:47.520" style="s2">when he found out about the scar. And who was</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.960" end="00:42:49.980" style="s2">repressed, in fact, he was</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.520" end="00:42:51.599" style="s2">banned. It is clear that there was a society of</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.980" end="00:42:53.220" style="s2">Dan Andruhovych. You could tell all about it.</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.599" end="00:42:55.800" style="s2">Maybe even show</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.220" end="00:43:00.839" style="s2">some copies of certain images,</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.800" end="00:43:02.780" style="s2">but I imagine when you are a young poet  and</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.839" end="00:43:04.740" style="s2">such a story opens before you</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.780" end="00:43:06.960" style="s2">Andruhovych, he really likes</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.740" end="00:43:09.680" style="s2">port  he has this whole series of</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.960" end="00:43:12.300" style="s2">fair portraits and he really likes to</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.680" end="00:43:14.880" style="s2">present someone to us</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.300" end="00:43:17.040" style="s2">in each of his novels. By the way, he has this,</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.880" end="00:43:19.140" style="s2">he has an output of heroes, and he lists</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.040" end="00:43:22.980" style="s2">these heroes to you, describes what they are like, and so on.</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.140" end="00:43:25.260" style="s2">And I would just like in some  a way to</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.980" end="00:43:27.240" style="s2">spy on Yuriy Andruhovich&#39;s consciousness at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.260" end="00:43:29.700" style="s2">moment when</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.240" end="00:43:33.420" style="s2">the image of Georgiy Narbu appears in</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.700" end="00:43:36.359" style="s2">his head and he wants to describe this</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.420" end="00:43:39.240" style="s2">difficult time of the revolution, the change of power, it is not</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.359" end="00:43:41.700" style="s2">clear what will happen next, but we still</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.240" end="00:43:45.079" style="s2">work with our alphabet, we work with</p>

<p begin="00:43:51.800" end="00:43:56.819" style="s2">Andruhovich, through his poetic language,</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.480" end="00:44:01.160" style="s2">is able to show this in a very cool way precisely because of</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.260" end="00:48:45.680" style="s2">, the humorous stories of Pavel Glazovoi, which were</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:49.440" style="s2">beautifully republished by Ivan Malkovich,</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.680" end="00:48:52.859" style="s2">were re-read in our house, and I and my</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.440" end="00:48:57.059" style="s2">sisters and my mother, and everyone had their own</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.859" end="00:48:59.420" style="s2">I knew my favorite by heart, because Pavlo</p>

<p begin="00:49:59.940" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">it was on Kalinin Square. Near the main</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.339" end="00:50:09.059" style="s2">post office at the taxi stop, I got in line and was</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:11.400" style="s2">reading something to myself. When I saw it, two</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.059" end="00:50:14.520" style="s2">boys crowded in front of me.</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.400" end="00:50:17.339" style="s2">I shooed them away.</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.520" end="00:50:20.339" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:50:17.339" end="00:50:23.760" style="s2">I noticed their statement. I looked at</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.339" end="00:50:25.740" style="s2">them and asked curiously where such beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.760" end="00:50:28.740" style="s2">women are hurrying to,</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.740" end="00:50:32.400" style="s2">and one of them. And we</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.740" end="00:50:34.980" style="s2">don&#39;t understand what Lukash is talking about with Khokhlyat calf tongues,</p>

<p begin="00:50:37.940" end="00:50:46.140" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.500" end="00:50:49.140" style="s2">going. The line roared with laughter, and they licked their tongues like a</p>

<p begin="00:50:49.140" end="00:50:56.400" style="s2">was on my side, said Lukash, it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.680" end="00:51:01.099" style="s2">that this story fit quite well in rhyme</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.400" end="00:51:04.200" style="s2">and with the humor of Glazovoy, because as we can see,</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.099" end="00:51:07.740" style="s2">cow epithets do not leave our</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.200" end="00:51:10.440" style="s2">classics, there is a cow, here is a calf. I  even</p>

<p begin="00:51:16.200" end="00:51:21.240" style="s2">don&#39;t use such words Well, because we can&#39;t,</p>

<p begin="00:51:29.940" end="00:51:34.140" style="s2">Nastya just came to visit me. And</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.220" end="00:51:37.380" style="s2">in Podol, not far from me,</p>

<p begin="00:51:49.559" end="00:51:53.880" style="s2">Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, there on the right are</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.480" end="00:51:56.400" style="s2">relics, on the left are the Institute of Books, and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.880" end="00:51:59.460" style="s2">brought two such two metal rods with</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.400" end="00:52:02.300" style="s2">which I measured biofields of the Lavra. We have a video of</p>

<p begin="00:52:05.400" end="00:52:10.760" style="s2">had to, so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.400" end="00:52:13.500" style="s2">, work together on</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.760" end="00:52:16.859" style="s2">all kinds of literary topics. In short,</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.500" end="00:52:18.960" style="s2">Nastya and Korbchuk measured everything. I believe</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.859" end="00:52:22.079" style="s2">that the biofield can be measured in everything,</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.960" end="00:52:24.660" style="s2">so swearing negatively affects our</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.079" end="00:52:26.760" style="s2">biofield, and so does the biofield  of our</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.660" end="00:52:28.740" style="s2">podcast and the microphones will start to rattle</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.760" end="00:52:31.200" style="s2">if we start cursing. And we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.740" end="00:52:32.180" style="s2">the microphones of the Motherland to be let down</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.200" end="00:52:35.040" style="s2">because they have been</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.180" end="00:52:38.400" style="s2">told so far without names  And he</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.040" end="00:52:42.000" style="s2">still has serious plans ahead, and these plans</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.400" end="00:52:43.819" style="s2">stretch like broad fields until the</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.000" end="00:52:45.720" style="s2">moment when the</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.819" end="00:52:48.720" style="s2">Russian-Ukrainian war ends and we</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.720" end="00:52:50.760" style="s2">will continue conversations and continue</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.720" end="00:52:52.920" style="s2">conversations until then, and there are still a</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.760" end="00:52:54.900" style="s2">lot of conversations because there are so many texts that need to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.920" end="00:52:57.420" style="s2">read in the shelter of films  which series are worth</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.900" end="00:53:01.079" style="s2">watching, which series are worth</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.420" end="00:53:03.780" style="s2">returning to, and of course, museums that</p>

<p begin="00:53:03.780" end="00:53:10.319" style="s2">turn on from various media, but to talk</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.160" end="00:53:13.380" style="s2">about all this, we need a little pause, a</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.319" end="00:53:16.680" style="s2">little break, as in the academic year,</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.380" end="00:53:19.200" style="s2">we finally have a period of spring,</p>

<p begin="00:53:45.240" end="00:53:50.420" style="s2">want the wrong one  to change the format, how to find a</p>
